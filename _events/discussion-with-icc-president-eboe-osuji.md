On March 27, the ABA welcomed International Criminal Court President Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji to its Washington, DC offices for a discussion of matters of mutual concern in international criminal justice.&nbsp; The discussion included ABA representatives from the ABA’s International Criminal Court Project, Criminal Justice Section, Center for Human Rights, and Governmental Affairs Office, as well as other civil society colleagues.

Since 1978, ABA&nbsp;[policy](https://www.aba-icc.org/the-aba-icc-project/aba-policy-on-the-icc/)&nbsp;has supported the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal and urged greater US governmental cooperation with the ICC to ensure accountability for atrocity crimes.
