On February 10, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the United States Congress hosted a very well-attended panel briefing on the potential role that the International Criminal Court (ICC) could play in achieving justice for atrocity crimes committed in Syria and Iraq.

The briefing began with opening remarks by co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, U.S. Representative James P. McGovern (D-Mass), who stressed that on-going mass atrocities in Syria and Iraq demand justice, and that the ICC and other avenues for accountability must be pursued.
