The panel included Janet Benshoof, president of the Global Justice Center and founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights, John Bellinger, former legal adviser of the Department of State, adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a partner at Arnold & Porter, and Stephen Lamony, senior advocate for Africa at Amnesty International.
