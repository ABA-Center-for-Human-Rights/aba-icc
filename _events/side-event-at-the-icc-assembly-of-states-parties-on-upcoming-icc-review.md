**The Hague, Netherlands, Dec. 2, 2019 -&nbsp;**Together with the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Human Rights Watch, the ICC Project (ABA's Criminal Justice Section and Center for Human Rights) cosponsored a side event at the [18th Assembly of States Parties](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/sessions/documentation/18th%20session/Pages/default.aspx) of the International Criminal Court. Mindful of the court-wide review process (which was [authorized](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/sessions/documentation/18th%20session/Pages/Review.aspx) by States Parties later in the week), the side event, titled **"A Civil Society Conversation on ICC Review: Towards a Victim-Centered Assessment of ICC Performance,"** brought together a diverse group of experts and advocates to highlight the unique perspectives that victims, affected communities, and civil society organizations can contribute to an ICC review process.
