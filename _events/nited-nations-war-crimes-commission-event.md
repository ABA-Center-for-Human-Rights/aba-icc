On August 7, 2013, American Univeristy Washington College of Law hosted a panel of experts to discuss the utility, history, and impact of the United Nations War Crimes Commission (1943-48). The panelists discussed the exclusion of the public from the Commissionâ€™s archives, and the potential utility of publicizing the archives.
