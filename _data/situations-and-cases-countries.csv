Kenya,KE,Situation,,The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election.,"The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election. After much controversy, the Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected. Supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to mass killings, injuries and displacements. The violence resulted in more than 1,100 people dead, 3,500 injured and up to 600, 000 forcibly displaced in six of Kenya’s eight provinces. The Republic of Kenya commissioned the Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence (Waki Commission) to investigate and report on the incidents. After the Kenyan Parliament twice rejected proposals to create a tribunal to investigate the crimes, the Commission sent their report, the names of those they deemed most responsible, and supporting evidence to the ICC Prosecutor. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a proprio motu investigation on Nov. 26, 2009, which was later authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber II on Mar. 31, 2010. Within the Kenya situation, there are three ongoing cases.",
Libya,LY,Situation,,The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011.,"The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011. Colonel Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi had ruled Libya since seizing power in 1969 and instituted a legal and political regime which allowed him to rule with absolute power. After the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions in early 2011, Gaddafi and the Libyan government allegedly began preparing for possible demonstrations in Libya. Initial protests in Libya began on February 15, 2011, when thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the police headquarters in Benghazi to protest the arrest of two Libyan lawyers and human rights activists. Libyan Security Forces allegedly openly fired into the crowd, killing many civilians. Additional protests followed these initial killings, then calling for Gaddafi’s government to step down. In the following weeks, Libyan Security Forces allegedly carried out a systematic attack against the civilian population, killing, injuring, arresting and disappearing hundreds of civilians perceived as dissidents, including civilians who participated in protests, talked to international media, or citizens of Egypt and Tunisia perceived to be associated with the uprising. The attacks followed the same pattern in multiple locations, but were especially prominent in Benghazi and Misrata. These attacks allegedly followed from a State policy, designed to maintain political power and to restrain demonstrators from protesting by all means, even by the use of lethal force. The Office of the Prosecutor asserts that exact figures are unavailable as a result of measures to cover up casualties, but cites some credible information estimating that 500-700 people were killed in the initial February shootings, and that thousands died over the course of the conflict. The United Nations estimates that approximately 535,000 migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers and 327,342 Libyans have been displaced. The Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the ICC on February 26, 2011 through unanimous Resolution 1970. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on March 3, 2011. Within the Libya situation, there is one ongoing case, with one case terminated after the death of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.",

Republic of Côte d'Ivoire,CI,Situation,,"The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from contested presidential elections in 2010, as well as a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire.","The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from contested presidential elections in 2010, as well as a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire. After former President Laurent Gbagbo was elected in 2000, Côte d'Ivoire endured a revolt in 2002 and a stagnated revolution thereafter. Control of the country was divided. The government held the mostly Christian south, and rebels controlled the mostly Muslim north. After Gbagbo refused to hold elections in 2004, the state allegedly ordered airstrikes against different rebel groups. Nine French soldiers were killed during the airstrikes.  In subsequent days, France destroyed Ivorian military aircraft and pro-government supporters attacked French Ivorians and French nationals.

The government refused to hold elections until 2010. In November 2010, former Prime Minister and Rally of the Republicans candidate Alessane Ouattara was elected President, but former President Gbabgo disputed the election results and refused to cede power. In November 2010, allegedly pro-Gbagbo forces attacked civilians in Abidjan and western Côte d'Ivoire perceived to be associated with the opposition, pursuant to an alleged state policy to target political opponents of Gbagbo and to retain political control of Côte d'Ivoire by any means necessary. The attacks allegedly targeted civilians often on the bases of suspected ethnic, religious, national or political affiliations. The attacking forces included defense and security forces, police, and militias (including youth groups) and armed mercenaries, some of which were allegedly recruited, armed, and given orders by governmental forces of Côte d'Ivoire. The situation escalated to an armed conflict between pro-Gbagbo forces and pro-Ouattara forces until April 2011, with forces from both sides allegedly committing murder, rape, other attacks against civilians and attacking cultural religious institutions.

The Republic of Côte d'Ivoire accepted ICC jurisdiction in April 2003 and again on 14 December 2010. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a proprio motu investigation on 23 June 2011, which was later authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber III on 3 October 2011. The Office of the Prosecutor initially requested authorization to investigate crimes since 28 November 2010, but the investigation was later expanded to cover evidence of crimes since 19 September 2002. Within the Côte d'Ivoire situation, there are three ongoing cases.",
