Central African Republic I ,CF,Situation ,,,"The situation in the Central African Republic involves an armed conflict between the part of the armed forces of the Central African Republic still loyal to then-President Ange‐Félix Patassé and the Mouvement de libération du Congo (Movement for the Liberation of Congo) (MLC)(commonly called the “Banyamulengue”) and a rebel movement led by François Bozizé (Patassé’s former Chief of Staff), who eventually seized control of the government and served as President of the Central African Republic from 2003-2012. Following Patassé’s accusation that Bozizé had been involved in a failed coup attempt by former President André Kolingba in 2001, the conflict erupted into a pattern of widespread sexual violence, killings and attacks against civilians mostly near the capital, Bangui and surrounding areas. The conflict was characterized by a high number of reported rapes and instances of sexual violence, with over 600 victims over this five-month period, with actual numbers likely much higher. These attacks often included aggravating aspects of cruelty, and resulted in social stigmatization and the spread of HIV/AIDs. The current investigation focuses on crimes committed during the peak of the violence, from October 2002 to March 2003, although the Office of the Prosecutor is also investigating potential crimes committed after violence resurged in 2005.  

The Central African Republic referred the situation to the ICC on 22 December 2004. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 22 May 2007. Within Central African Republic situation, there are two ongoing cases.

"Darfur, Sudan",SD,Situation,,,"The situation in the Republic of Sudan involves a conflict between the government of the Republic of Sudan and several armed groups who are fighting for access to and control over resources and land, as well as increased rights for their perceived disadvantaged tribes or social groups. These groups include the Sudan Liberation Army Minni Minawi (SLA-MM), Sudan Liberation Army Abdul Wahid (SLA-AW), Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM-K), several of which later formed a coalition called the United Resistance Front (URF). In Darfur, the conflict also has an ethnic dimension. From 2003-05 of the Darfur conflict, pro-government Arab militias (including the Janjaweed, also known as the “Moujahadeen”) were accused of conducting an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arabs. In combatting rebel forces in Darfur, these pro-government militias allegedly attacked civilian populations, looted civilian property and forced displacement. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that since 2005, the Government of the Republic of Sudan has used armed groups to act as its proxies in Darfur, including the Janjaweed. Attacks on aid workers and peacekeepers have also occurred throughout the conflict. Several different parties have been accused of committing human rights violations and attacks on the civilian population, and while displacement and re-displacement make accurate numbers difficult to report, tens of thousands of refuges have been displaced by individual attacks. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that 460,000 people have been newly displaced in 2013 alone. 

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan established the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur in October 2004, and finding reason to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed in Darfur, the Commission recommended the Security Council refer the situation to the ICC in January 2005. The Security Council referred the situation in Sudan to the ICC on 31 March 2005 through Resolution 1593. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 6 June 2005. Within the Sudan situation, there are five cases.

Kenya,KE,Situation,,The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election.,"The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election. After much controversy, the Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected. Supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to mass killings, injuries and displacements. The violence resulted in more than 1,100 people dead, 3,500 injured and up to 600, 000 forcibly displaced in six of Kenya’s eight provinces. The Republic of Kenya commissioned the Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence (Waki Commission) to investigate and report on the incidents. After the Kenyan Parliament twice rejected proposals to create a tribunal to investigate the crimes, the Commission sent their report, the names of those they deemed most responsible, and supporting evidence to the ICC Prosecutor. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a proprio motu investigation on Nov. 26, 2009, which was later authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber II on Mar. 31, 2010. Within the Kenya situation, there are three ongoing cases.",
Libya,LY,Situation,,The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011.,"The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011. Colonel Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi had ruled Libya since seizing power in 1969 and instituted a legal and political regime which allowed him to rule with absolute power. After the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions in early 2011, Gaddafi and the Libyan government allegedly began preparing for possible demonstrations in Libya. Initial protests in Libya began on February 15, 2011, when thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the police headquarters in Benghazi to protest the arrest of two Libyan lawyers and human rights activists. Libyan Security Forces allegedly openly fired into the crowd, killing many civilians. Additional protests followed these initial killings, then calling for Gaddafi’s government to step down. In the following weeks, Libyan Security Forces allegedly carried out a systematic attack against the civilian population, killing, injuring, arresting and disappearing hundreds of civilians perceived as dissidents, including civilians who participated in protests, talked to international media, or citizens of Egypt and Tunisia perceived to be associated with the uprising. The attacks followed the same pattern in multiple locations, but were especially prominent in Benghazi and Misrata. These attacks allegedly followed from a State policy, designed to maintain political power and to restrain demonstrators from protesting by all means, even by the use of lethal force. The Office of the Prosecutor asserts that exact figures are unavailable as a result of measures to cover up casualties, but cites some credible information estimating that 500-700 people were killed in the initial February shootings, and that thousands died over the course of the conflict. The United Nations estimates that approximately 535,000 migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers and 327,342 Libyans have been displaced. The Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the ICC on February 26, 2011 through unanimous Resolution 1970. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on March 3, 2011. Within the Libya situation, there is one ongoing case, with one case terminated after the death of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.",
Mali,ML,Situation,,,"The situation in the Republic of Mali involves a conflict between government forces of the Republic of Mali and several armed groups fighting for independence or increased autonomy, including the Mouvement national de libération de l’Azawad (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, MNLA), al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine and the Mouvement pour l’unicité et le jihad en Afrique de l’Ouest (Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, MUJAO) and other militias. The insurgency began in January 2012, and peaked with the seizure of much of northern Mali by rebel groups in April 2012. On 22 March 2012, President Toure was forcefully ousted shortly before scheduled Presidential elections. After April, these various groups also fought amongst themselves, attempting to gain exclusive control of northern Mali. In carrying out their insurgency, various groups allegedly executed detainees and inflicted severe punishments, including torture. As armed groups took control of northern Mali, reports of looting and rape were reported, and groups allegedly destroyed religious buildings and institutions in Timbuktu and other areas. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that as of 1 November 2012, 412,000 people had allegedly been displaced, half of which were refugees in surrounding countries. The Republic of Mali referred the situation to the ICC on 18 July 2012. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 13 January 2013. Within the situation in the Republic of Mali, there are not yet any cases against specific individuals.",

Republic of Côte d'Ivoire,CI,Situation,,"The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from contested presidential elections in 2010, as well as a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire.","The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from contested presidential elections in 2010, as well as a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire. After former President Laurent Gbagbo was elected in 2000, Côte d'Ivoire endured a revolt in 2002 and a stagnated revolution thereafter. Control of the country was divided. The government held the mostly Christian south, and rebels controlled the mostly Muslim north. After Gbagbo refused to hold elections in 2004, the state allegedly ordered airstrikes against different rebel groups. Nine French soldiers were killed during the airstrikes.  In subsequent days, France destroyed Ivorian military aircraft and pro-government supporters attacked French Ivorians and French nationals.

The government refused to hold elections until 2010. In November 2010, former Prime Minister and Rally of the Republicans candidate Alessane Ouattara was elected President, but former President Gbabgo disputed the election results and refused to cede power. In November 2010, allegedly pro-Gbagbo forces attacked civilians in Abidjan and western Côte d'Ivoire perceived to be associated with the opposition, pursuant to an alleged state policy to target political opponents of Gbagbo and to retain political control of Côte d'Ivoire by any means necessary. The attacks allegedly targeted civilians often on the bases of suspected ethnic, religious, national or political affiliations. The attacking forces included defense and security forces, police, and militias (including youth groups) and armed mercenaries, some of which were allegedly recruited, armed, and given orders by governmental forces of Côte d'Ivoire. The situation escalated to an armed conflict between pro-Gbagbo forces and pro-Ouattara forces until April 2011, with forces from both sides allegedly committing murder, rape, other attacks against civilians and attacking cultural religious institutions.

The Republic of Côte d'Ivoire accepted ICC jurisdiction in April 2003 and again on 14 December 2010. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a proprio motu investigation on 23 June 2011, which was later authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber III on 3 October 2011. The Office of the Prosecutor initially requested authorization to investigate crimes since 28 November 2010, but the investigation was later expanded to cover evidence of crimes since 19 September 2002. Within the Côte d'Ivoire situation, there are three ongoing cases.",
The Democratic Republic of the Congo,CD,Situation,,,"The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) involves a protracted armed conflict between the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and many armed groups.  The DRC has been the setting for armed conflict since the First Congo War in 1996, which included overflow from conflicts in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda as well as regional alliance between the three countries. Violence erupted again in 1998, when armed rebel groups began to engage with forces of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the Second Congo War). During this period, up to 25 armed groups and eight African states were involved in support of one side or the other. The Government of the DRC finalized a peace agreement with rebel groups in 2003 (as well as in Ituri in 2007 and Kivu in 2009), but various groups continued to engage in armed conflict in the eastern parts of the country throughout the past decade. The Office of the Prosecutor’s investigation initially focused on crimes committed in the Ituri region, where the conflict has been particularly devastating and includes fighting over resources, as well as an ethnic dimension between those of Hema and Lendu ethnicity. The conflict has been characterized by patterns of brutality and attacks against civilians, including rape, torture, force displacement, the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and mass murder. The Office of the Prosecutor estimates that millions of civilians have died over the course of the conflict.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo referred the situation to the ICC on 3 March 2004. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 21 June 2004. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was the first investigation opened by the ICC. Within the Democratic Republic of the Congo situation, there are five cases.",
Uganda,UG,Situation,,,"The situation in the Republic of Uganda involves a protracted conflict between the government of the Republic of Uganda and armed rebel groups, primarily the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). The LRA has waged an ongoing insurgency against the Ugandan government, the Ugandan Army, and local defense units since 1987.  In carrying out their insurgency, the LRA has consistently targeted and directed attacks against civilians, including those civilians which the Ugandan Army has placed in internal displacement camps to better protect them against LRA attacks. As part of these attacks, the LRA used a variety of tactics to brutalize the civilian population, including mass murder, mutilation, and forcefully abducting children to be child soldiers, servants, and sex slaves.  The LRA’s insurgency has caused tens of thousands of deaths and abductions, and has displaced up to two million civilians throughout the region. Although the Lord’s Resistance Army has been inactive in northern Uganda since 2006, it still operates in the border region between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. The Republic of Uganda referred the situation to the ICC on 16 December 2003. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 29 July 2004. Within the Ugandan situation, there is one ongoing case.
