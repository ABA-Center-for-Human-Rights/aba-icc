After the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared on 30 December 2007 that incumbent PNU candidate Mwai Kibaki had won the presidential election, thousands of members of the network allegedly began to attack PNU supporters in Turbo, Huruma, Kimumu, Langas, Yamumbi, Kapsabet and Nandi Hills. They allegedly burnt down the houses of political opponents, killed civilians and forced them out of their homes. On 1 January 2008, at least 17 people died in an incident where network members allegedly burnt down a church in Kiambaa with more than 100 people inside.

,Henry Kiprono Kosgey,Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM),Pretrial: Charges not confirmed ,2011-03-08,2011-04-07,2012-01-23,"**Crime against humanity (3 counts)**: murder, forcible transfer of population and persecution; criminal responsibility as having committed the crime as an individual or jointly or through another.","Along with Joshua Arap Sang and William Samoei Ruto, Kosgey allegedly established a network in 2006 which he later used to commit crimes directed against supporters of the Party of National Unity (PNU). Kosgey, Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) during the 2007-2008 elections, allegedly attended ODM meetings where leaders planned the post-election violence. 

Pre-Trial Chamber II decided not to confirm the charges against Kosgey, deciding that witnesses at that stage in the proceedings had only spoken of Kosgey’s attendance generally but not his specific role in ODM. The Pre-Trial Chamber decided that the combination of the anonymous witness’s uncorroborated statements and the redaction of dates when Kosgey allegedly attended ODM meetings meant the Office of the Prosecutor did not meet the evidentiary burden to confirm charges against Kosgey at that time.

KE-2,Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta,President of the Republic of Kenya,,2011-03-08,2011-04-08,2012-01-23,"**Crime against humanity (5 counts)**: murder, forcible transfer of population, rape, persecution and other inhumane acts of inflicting serious bodily injury and suffering; criminal responsibility as having committed the crime as an individual or jointly or through another.","Kenyatta and members of the Mungiki (a criminal organization) allegedly developed and executed a common plan to attack perceived ODM supporters in order to keep the Party of National Unity (PNU) in power in the 2007-2008 elections. In executing the common plan, Kenyatta allegedly facilitated meetings with Francis Muthaura (then head of the Civil Service and Chairman of the National Security Committee and a former defendant in the case) and members of the Mungiki in order to prepare widespread attacks against civilians perceived to support ODM, and to instruct Kenyan Police Forces not to interfere with the movement of pro-PNU and Mungiki members. Kenyatta allegedly helped to facilitate post-election attacks by providing transportation, funding, weapons, and logistical support to the direct perpetrators.

Allegedly carrying out the plan, Kenyan Police Forces were deployed into Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) strongholds where they used excessive force against civilian protesters in Kisumu and Kibera. Kenyan Police Forces allegedly shot indiscriminately and killed more than a hundred perceived ODM supporters in Kisumu and Kiberia from December 2007-mid January 2008.
