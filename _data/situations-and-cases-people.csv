Once recruited whether  voluntarily or through force, children under the age of 15 were sent to military training camps, and were deployed as soldiers in Bunia, Tchomia, Kasenyi, Bogoro and took part in fighting in areas including Kobu, Songolo and Mongbwalu. The UPC/FPLC used children as military guards and to compose a special “Kadogo Unit” whose ranks were primarily children. The Office of the Prosecutor presented evidence that Lubanga personally made speeches encouraging children under the age of 15 to join the UPC/FPLC and personally used bodyguards who were under the age of 15.

The MLC was allegedly composed largely of individuals of Congolese or Rwandan origin (commonly called 'Banyamulenge'), and sided with President Patassé’s troops in the conflict. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Bemba and President Patassé had a plan to retain Patassé’s power by any means, and that in return, Bemba would receive support for the MLC by ensuring that the Central African Republic did not formally align with the then-government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bemba’s support and maintaining the MLC’s force in the Central African Republic was allegedly essential to achieving this common plan.

The Pre-Trial Chamber decided that the combination of the anonymous witness’s uncorroborated statements and the redaction of dates when Kosgey allegedly attended ODM meetings meant the Office of the Prosecutor did not meet the evidentiary burden to confirm charges against Kosgey at that time.
