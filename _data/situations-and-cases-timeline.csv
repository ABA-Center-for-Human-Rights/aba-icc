,2004,CD,Investigation,The Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) involves a protracted armed conflict between the Government of the DRC and many armed groups.  Armed conflict began in 1996 with the First Congo War, which included overflow from conflicts in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. During the Second Congo War (beginning in 1998) up to 25 armed rebel groups and eight African states formed various alliances in support of or opposing DRC government forces. The Government of the DRC finalized a peace agreement with rebel groups in 2003 (as well as in Ituri in 2007 and Kivu in 2009), but various groups continued to clash in eastern DRC throughout the past decade, exploiting tension over resources and between ethnic groups. The conflict has been characterized by patterns of brutality and attacks against civilians, including rape, torture, force displacement, the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and mass murder. The Office of the Prosecutor estimates that millions of civilians have died over the course of the conflict. The Democratic Republic of the Congo referred the situation to the ICC on 3 March 2004. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation (the ICC’s first) on 21 June 2004. Within the Democratic Republic of the Congo situation, there are five cases.",
,2005,SD,Investigation,"Darfur, Sudan","The situation in the Republic of Sudan involves a conflict between the Government of the Republic of Sudan and several armed groups fighting for control over resources and land and increased rights for their perceived disadvantaged tribes or social groups. The conflict has been especially intense in Darfur, where pro-government militias (including the Janjaweed or “Moujahadeen”) allegedly conducted an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arabs from 2003-2005. In combatting rebel groups in Darfur, pro-government militias and proxies also allegedly attacked, looted property and forced displacement of civilian populations. The conflict has been characterized by massive human rights violations, attacks on civilians and aid workers and forced displacements. Individual attacks have allegedly displaced tens of thousands of refuges at a time, and the Office of the Prosecutor alleges that 460,000 people were newly displaced in 2013 alone. Following the recommendation and findings of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, the Security Council referred the situation in Sudan to the ICC on 31 March 2005 through Resolution 1593. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 6 June 2005. Within the Sudan situation, there are five cases.",
,2008,KE,Investigation,The Situation in Kenya,"The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election. After much controversy, the Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President was re-elected, but supporters of the opposition candidate rejected the results and accused the government of electoral fraud. Post-election violence unfolded largely along tribal lines, and the series of protests and demonstrations that followed resulted in more than 1,100 people dead, 3,500 injured and up to 600,000 forcibly displaced in six of Kenya’s eight provinces. The Kenyan-created Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (“Waki Commission”) investigated and created a report on the crimes, but sent their findings to the ICC Prosecutor after the Kenyan Parliament twice rejected proposals to create a tribunal to investigate the crimes in Kenya. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a *proprio motu* investigation on 26 November 2009. Within the Kenya situation, there are two ongoing cases.",
,2010,CI,Investigation,The Situation in Côte d'Ivoire,"The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire and
contested presidential elections in 2010. After former President Laurent Gbagbo was elected in 2000, Côte d'Ivoire endured a revolt in 2002 and a stagnated revolution thereafter. After Gbagbo refused to hold elections in 2004, the government allegedly ordered airstrikes against different rebel groups, resulting in the death of nine French soldiers and subsequent fighting between pro-government supporters, French Ivorians and French nationals. When the government finally held elections in November 2010, former President Gbabgo refused to cede power to President-elect Alessane Ouattara, and pro-Gbagbo forces allegedly attacked civilians perceived to be associated with the opposition, often on the bases of suspected ethnic, religious, national or political affiliations. Both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara forces allegedly attacked cultural religious institutions and committed murder, rape, other attacks against civilians throughout the conflict until April 2011. The Republic of Côte d'Ivoire accepted ICC jurisdiction in April 2003 and again on 14 December 2010. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a *proprio motu* investigation on 23 June 2011, which was later authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber III. Initially covering crimes since 28 November 2010, the investigation was later expanded to cover evidence of crimes since 19 September 2002. Within the Côte d'Ivoire situation, there are three ongoing cases.",
,2011,LY,Investigation,The Situation in Libya,"The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011. Initial protests in Libya began on 15 February 2011, soon after popular uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, when Libyan Security Forces allegedly openly fired into a crowd of thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest the arrest of two Libyan lawyers and human rights activists in Benghazi. In the following weeks, as additional protests called for Colonel Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi’s government (in power since 1969) to step down, Libyan Security Forces allegedly carried out a systematic attack against the civilian population, killing, injuring, arresting and disappearing hundreds of civilians perceived as dissidents. The Office of the Prosecutor estimates that 500-700 people were killed in the initial February shootings, and that thousands died over the course of the conflict. The United Nations estimates that approximately 535,000 migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers and 327,342 Libyans have been displaced. The Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the ICC on 26 February 2011 through unanimous Resolution 1970. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 3 March 2011. Within the Libya situation, there is one ongoing case, with one case terminated after the death of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.",
