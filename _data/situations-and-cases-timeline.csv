",
,2004,CF,Investigation,The Situation in the Central African Republic (I),"The first situation in the Central African Republic (CAR I) involves an armed conflict between the part of the armed forces still loyal to then-President Ange‐Félix Patassé and several armed groups.

,2005,SD,Investigation,"The Situation in Darfur, Sudan","The situation in the Republic of Sudan involves a conflict between the Government of the Republic of Sudan and several armed groups fighting for control over resources and land and increased rights for their perceived disadvantaged tribes or social groups. The conflict has been especially intense in Darfur, where pro-government militias allegedly conducted an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arabs from 2003-2005. The conflict has been characterized by massive human rights violations, attacks on civilians and aid workers and forced displacements of hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Côte d'Ivoire endured a revolt in 2002 and a stagnated revolution thereafter. When former President Gbabgo refused to cede power after elections in November 2010, pro-Gbagbo forces allegedly attacked civilians perceived to be associated with the opposition, and both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara forces allegedly committed murder, rape, other attacks against civilians throughout the conflict until April 2011.
