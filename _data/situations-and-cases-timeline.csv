,2010,CI,Investigation,The Situation in Côte d'Ivoire,"The situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire involves violence resulting from a decade of tension over the leadership of Côte d'Ivoire and contested presidential elections in 2010. Côte d'Ivoire endured a revolt in 2002 and a stagnated revolution thereafter. When former President Gbabgo refused to cede power after elections in November 2010, pro-Gbagbo forces allegedly attacked civilians perceived to be associated with the opposition, and both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara forces allegedly committed murder, rape, other attacks against civilians throughout the conflict until April 2011.

,2005,SD,Investigation,"The Situation in Darfur, Sudan","The situation in the Republic of Sudan involves a conflict between the Government of the Republic of Sudan and several armed groups fighting for control over resources and land and increased rights for their perceived disadvantaged tribes or social groups. The conflict has been especially intense in Darfur, where pro-government militias allegedly conducted an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arabs from 2003-2005. The conflict has been characterized by massive human rights violations, attacks on civilians and aid workers and forced displacements of hundreds of thousands of civilians.

More than 1,100 people died, 3,500 were injured and up to 600,000 forcibly displaced over the course of the violence. After receiving a report on the crimes from a Kenyan-created commission, the Office of the Prosecutor opened a *proprio motu* investigation on 26 November 2009.",

Additional protests in the following weeks called for Colonel Gaddafi’s government to step down, and Libyan Security Forces allegedly killed, injured, arrested and disappeared hundreds of civilians perceived as dissidents. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were displaced over the course of the conflict. The Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the ICC on 26 February 2011 through unanimous Resolution 1970, and the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 3 March 2011.",

The insurgency began in January 2012 and President Amadou Toumani Touré was forcefully ousted on 22 March 2012 shortly before scheduled Presidential elections. Violence peaked with the seizure of much of northern Mali in April 2012, and in fighting to control the region afterwards, various groups allegedly executed detainees, inflicted severe punishments (including torture), and raped civilians, looted property and destroyed cultural property. The Republic of Mali referred the situation to the ICC on 18 July 2012 and the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 16 January 2013.",
