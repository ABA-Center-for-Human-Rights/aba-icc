,2008,KE,Investigation,The Situation in Kenya,"The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country’s contested 2007-2008 election. After much controversy, the Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President was re-elected, but supporters of the opposition candidate rejected the results and accused the government of electoral fraud. Post-election violence unfolded largely along tribal lines, and the series of protests and demonstrations that followed resulted in more than 1,100 people dead, 3,500 injured and up to 600,000 forcibly displaced in six of Kenya’s eight provinces. The Kenyan-created Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (“Waki Commission”) investigated and created a report on the crimes, but sent their findings to the ICC Prosecutor after the Kenyan Parliament twice rejected proposals to create a tribunal to investigate the crimes in Kenya. The Office of the Prosecutor initiated a *proprio motu* investigation on 26 November 2009. Within the Kenya situation, there are two ongoing cases.

,2011,LY,Investigation,The Situation in Libya,"The situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Libya) involves mass violence that occurred throughout Libya’s six month popular uprising in 2011. Initial protests in Libya began on 15 February 2011, soon after popular uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, when Libyan Security Forces allegedly openly fired into a crowd of thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest the arrest of two Libyan lawyers and human rights activists in Benghazi. In the following weeks, as additional protests called for Colonel Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi’s government (in power since 1969) to step down, Libyan Security Forces allegedly carried out a systematic attack against the civilian population, killing, injuring, arresting and disappearing hundreds of civilians perceived as dissidents. The Office of the Prosecutor estimates that 500-700 people were killed in the initial February shootings, and that thousands died over the course of the conflict. The United Nations estimates that approximately 535,000 migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers and 327,342 Libyans have been displaced. The Security Council referred the situation in Libya to the ICC on 26 February 2011 through unanimous Resolution 1970. Following a preliminary investigation, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on 3 March 2011. Within the Libya situation, there is one ongoing case, with one case terminated after the death of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.
