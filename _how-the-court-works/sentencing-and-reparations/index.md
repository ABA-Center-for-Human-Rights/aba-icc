If an Accused is convicted, the Trial Chambers (TC) must determine the appropriate sentence taken into a range of factors, such as the gravity of the crimes and the convicted personâ€™s role in the crimes.&nbsp;

The death penalty is not permitted at the ICC. The TC can impose a life imprisonment or any number of years not exceeding 30 years. Time in jail during trial is subtracted from the sentence. The TC can also issue fines and/or forfeiture of proceeds, property, or assets derived directly or indirectly from the crimes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

If the sentence and/or other punishment issued by the TC is appealed by the Office of the Prosecutor, convicted person, and/or the Victims, the Appeals Chambers has the power to uphold, reverse, or amend the sentence and/or other punishment issued.&nbsp;
