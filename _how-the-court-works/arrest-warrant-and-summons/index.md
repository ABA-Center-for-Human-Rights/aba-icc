During the course of an investigation, if sufficient evidence identifies an individual as responsible for the alleged crimes, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) may request the three-member Pre-Trial Chambers (PTC) to issue an summons (when the individual will voluntarily appear) or arrest warrant.&nbsp; If satisfied that the evidence presented established reasonable grounds to believe the individual is responsible, the PTC will then issue the summons or arrest warrant. &nbsp;
