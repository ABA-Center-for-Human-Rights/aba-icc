No. In fact, the ICC was established on the **principle of complementarity**, or the belief that national courts have the right and responsibility to be the *first*jurisdiction to investigate and/or prosecute alleged atrocity crimes. The ICC is *only*a court of last resort where the national courts fail to investigate or prosecute. So, the ICC only *complements*national courts, it does not replace them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

How does the ICC decide when to get involved then? By law, the ICC can only pursue an investigation and prosecution if the national jurisdiction is genuinely "**unwilling and unable**" to carry out an investigation and/or prosecution themselves. In other words, if a national jurisdiction is willing and able to handle the atrocity crimes themselves, the ICC is legally prohibited from getting involved. Yet, the national investigations and prosecutions must be genuine, independent, impartial, and not unjustifiably delayed, or else the ICC may get involved.&nbsp;

Additionally, the ICC may only pursue the case if it is of "**sufficient gravity**" to justify the ICC's involvement. This means, for example, that an atrocity crime may have occurred, but it is not a sufficient grave criminal act to justify an ICC investigation and/or prosecution.&nbsp;
