The rights of the Accused are one of the most fundamentally important aspects of the ICC. Some of these rights include: the right to legal representation of their choice; the right to a trial without undue delay, right to prepare for trial; the right to all evidence; the right to communicate and to understand the charges against them in a language they understand, to name a few rights.
