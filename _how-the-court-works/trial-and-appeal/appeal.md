The Office of the Prosecutor, Accused, and/or Victims can appeal the Trial Chamber’s judgement to the five-member Appeals Chamber (AC). The AC will review the judgement for errors of law, procedures, and/or fact, and hold public hearings to listen to arguments from the parties.&nbsp;

After their deliberations in secret are concluded, the AC will issue its own judgement that upholds the TC’s judgement (some or all of it), reverse or amend the TC judgement (some or all of it), or order a new trial with a different TC.&nbsp;
