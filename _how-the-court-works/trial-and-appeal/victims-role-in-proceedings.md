The [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf) grants victims an unprecedented role in ICC proceedings. Under the Statute, victims who have satisfied the necessary criteria have the right to present their “views and concerns” at proceedings, with the Chambers determining when and how it is “appropriate” for a victim to do so. Following a written application, a legal representative is chosen to represent the views of the victim.

Victims’ roles vary throughout proceedings. In the PTC, legal representatives have been allowed to make opening and closing statements, in addition to written statements. In the TC, victims may submit evidence to the Court and ask questions to those testifying before the Court, including the Accused. At this stage, the victim may appear in person. In the AC, victims must apply every time they wish to participate, and can only appeal decisions on reparations after conviction. Throughout, victims have the right to protection and notification of proceedings.
