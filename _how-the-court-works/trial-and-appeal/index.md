The three-member Trial Chamber conducts the trial and must ensure a fair and expeditious trial; protects the rights of the Accused and Victims; and ensure the protection of witnesses and others involved in the trial. All trials are public with the exception of “closed sessions” that occur to protect certain witnesses and confidentiality.&nbsp;

First step of a trial is to allow the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to present its evidence in order to prove the Accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defense and Victims are allowed to questions the strength of the OTP evidence presented and/or support with additional evidence. Once the OTP’s case is concluded, the Accused and his/her defense team can present their own evidence. The OTP and Victims are allowed to question the strength of the Defense evidence as well.&nbsp;

Once the trial is complete, the TC deliberates in secret, and must either find the Accused guilty or not guilty with written justifications for their decision, called a “judgement.”
