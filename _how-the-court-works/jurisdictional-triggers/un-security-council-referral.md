The UN Security Council may refer any country in the world (States Parties or non-States Parties) to the Prosecutor by passing a resolution authorized by the UN Charter.&nbsp;

In February 2011, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1970, referring the situation in Libya (a non-State Party) to the ICC.&nbsp;
