A Proprio Motu investigation (“on one’s own initiative” in Latin) is when the Prosecutor opens her own preliminary examination of alleged atrocities in either the territory of or of nationals from any State Party or a non-State Party that has retroactively accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction. In all Proprio Motu investigations, the Prosecutor must receive judicial authorization from the Pre-Trial Chambers to open a formal investigation.
