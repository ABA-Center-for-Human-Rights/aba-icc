A State Party referral is when any of the ICC States Parties refers to the Prosecutor alleged atrocities that have occurred on the territory of any State Party or by a national from any State Party. To date, States Parties have most commonly referred to the Prosecutor allegations of crimes committed on their own territory or by their own citizens.
