The alleged crimes must have occurred after July 1, 2002, the date that the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf) (the treaty that established the ICC) went into force. If the alleged crimes occurred prior to this date, the case cannot move forward at the ICC.
