#### Jurisdiction

**Can the court prosecute a country or company?**

No. The ICC can only investigate and/or prosecute "natural persons", or individuals. It cannot investigate and/or prosecute countries or corporations. However, an individual could be investigated for alleged criminal acts they participated in while a corporate official.&nbsp;
