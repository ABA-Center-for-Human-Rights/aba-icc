The alleged crimes must be the gravest of atrocity crimes. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor determines gravity by looking at the scale, nature, manner and impact of the alleged crimes.

In 2013, the Court received a State Party referral from the Union of Comoros regarding an Israeli interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip in 2010. The Court opened a preliminary examination and despite meeting the jurisdictional qualifications, due to the limited scale of the crimes, the case did not meet the qualification for gravity. The Court thus did not proceed to investigations. &nbsp;

*Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus* were charged with killing 12 African Union peacekeepers in 2007. Despite the relatively small number of deaths, the Court found that the crime also is an attack on the millions of civilians the peacekeepers were sent to protect and, thus, meets the gravity [threshold]()&nbsp;.
