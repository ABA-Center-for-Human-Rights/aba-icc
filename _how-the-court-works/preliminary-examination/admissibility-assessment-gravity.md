The alleged crimes must be the gravest of atrocity crimes. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor determines gravity by looking at the scale, nature, manner and impact of the alleged crimes.

In 2013, the Court received a State Party referral from the Union of Comoros regarding an Israeli interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip in 2010. The Court opened a preliminary examination and despite meeting the jurisdictional qualifications, due to the limited scale of the crimes, the case did not meet the qualification for gravity. The Court thus did not proceed to investigations. &nbsp;
