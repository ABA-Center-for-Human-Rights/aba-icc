Even where the jurisdictional and admissibility requirements, the Rome Statute allows the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) the discretion to determine if the case moving forward at the ICC serves “the interest of justice” If it determines there are substantial reasons to believe a formal investigation will not help achieve justice, the OTP may close the case. However, this determination can be reviewed by a three-member Pre-Trial Chamber.&nbsp;
