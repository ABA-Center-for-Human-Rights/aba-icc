The ICC is the world’s only permanent international criminal tribunal, but its jurisdiction is still limited. In light of jurisdictional limitations placed on it, the ICC may be able to investigate atrocities in some places, but not others. 

The ICC has jurisdiction in the territory of, and over the nationals from, the 124 countries - called States Parties - that have formally joined it. The map below shows in blue the ICC States Parties. 

The ICC may also have jurisdiction in non-States Parties and over their nationals if either 1.) the UN Security Council grants the ICC jurisdiction in a non-State Party by resolution or 2.) the non-State Party accepts the ICC’s jurisdiction by declaration. Typically, when the UN Security Council resolution and a country’s declaration grants the ICC jurisdiction, they will also request that the ICC investigate alleged atrocity crimes. This issue is discussed next.
