Even where the jurisdictional and admissibility requirements are met, the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf) allows the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) the discretion to determine if the case moving forward at the ICC serves “the interest of justice.” The OTP may close the case if it determines there are substantial reasons to believe a formal investigation will not help achieve justice. However, a three-member Pre-Trial Chamber can review this decision.
