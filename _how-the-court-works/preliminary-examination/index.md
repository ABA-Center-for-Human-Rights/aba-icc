If allegations of crimes appear to have occurred within the jurisdiction of the ICC, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) may open the initial phase of a case called a “preliminary examination”. In a preliminary examination, the OTP determines whether or not the case meets several requirements to open a formal investigation called a “situation”.&nbsp;

The preliminary examination has four phases of analysis: initial assessment, jurisdictional assessment, admissibility assessment, and interests of justice assessment.&nbsp;
