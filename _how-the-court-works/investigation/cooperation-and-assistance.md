* It does not have its own police force or independent enforcement powers{: .present-before-paste}
* It cannot enter or obtain evidence in sovereign countries without the country’s permission.{: .present-before-paste}


As a result, the ICC depends on the “cooperation and assistance” of countries in order to facilitate investigations and prosecutions. Cooperation and assistance may include:

* Allowing access to documents and other evidence;
* Tasking domestic personnel to assist the OTP
* Helping locate witnesses and victims; and
