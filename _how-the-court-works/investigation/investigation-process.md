If all requirements of a preliminary examination are satisfied, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) will initiate a formal “investigation” into a “situation” (such as, the situation in Libya).&nbsp;

OTP investigators will attempt to gain as much information as possible to construct an accurate interpretation of the events of the alleged crime as well as to determine who is most responsible. Investigators will travel to the areas where the alleged crimes occurred and collect evidence like documents and forensics; interview witnesses and victims; consult with relevant experts and specialists; analyze financial transactions; and use modern technology to uncover additional evidence.&nbsp;

During the investigation, the OTP is legally required to gather all evidence, including “incriminating” and “exonerating” evidence. All of this evidence must be given to the Defense in order to establish the truth of the events.
