The crime of aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, integrity or independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. The definition of the crime of aggression ([Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/RS-Eng.pdf)art. 8*bis*) was adopted through amendment to the Statute as part of the 2010 Review Conference in Kampala, Uganda, and jurisdiction was activated in 2018. There are some additional limitations on the ICC's[exercise of jurisdiction](https://www.coalitionfortheicc.org/sites/default/files/cicc_documents/CICC-%20Factsheet%20Crime%20of%20Aggression%20Final-%20changes%2027Nov2019.pdf) over the crime of aggression.&nbsp;
