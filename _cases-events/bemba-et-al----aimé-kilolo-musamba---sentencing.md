Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and EUR 30,000 fine. The time that Mr. Kilolo previously spent in detention was deducted and the Chamber ordered the suspension of the remaining term of imprisonment for a period of 3 years so that the sentence shall not take effect (i) if Mr. Kilolo pays the fine; and (ii) unless during that period Mr. Kilolo commits another offence anywhere that is punishable with imprisonment.
