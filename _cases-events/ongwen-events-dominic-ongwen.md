Pre-Trial Chamber II issued a sealed [arrest warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/05-57) for Dominic Ongwen on July 8, 2005, which was [unsealed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/15-34) on October 13, 2005. Mr. Ongwen surrendered in the Central African Republic on January 16, 2015 and was [transferred to ICC custody](https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/item.aspx?name=pr1084)&nbsp;on January 17, 2015. Mr. Ongwen made an&nbsp;[initial appearance](https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/item.aspx?name=PR1085) before Pretrial Chamber II on January 26, 2015.

Pre-Trial Chamber II [severed the proceedings against Mr. Ongwen](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/05-424) from the case on February 6, 2015 due to the absence of other suspects ([Joseph Kony](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/joseph-kony/), [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/), and [Okot Odhiambo](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/okot-odhiambo/)) whose whereabouts were still unknown and the risk of serious prejudice to Mr. Ongwen's defense from further delay in the proceedings.&nbsp;

On March 23, 2016, Pre-Trial Chamber II&nbsp;[confirmed the charges](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/15-422-Red); on April 29, 2016, Pre-Trial Chamber II [rejected the Defenceâ€™s request for leave to appeal](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/15-428)&nbsp;issues in the confirmation of charges decision. Trial Chamber IX later&nbsp;[set the trial commencement date for December 6, 2016](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/04-01/15-449).<br><br>On February 4, 2021, Trial Chamber IX [found](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1564) Mr. Ongwen [guilty](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2021_01026.PDF) ([summary](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/ongwen-verdict/2021.02.03-Ongwen-judgment-Summary.pdf)) of 61 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both directly and indirectly in northern Uganda from July 2002 to December 2005. The crimes included those committed as part of attacks against the civilian population in four specific attacks on internally displaced person camps (Pajule, Odek, Lukodi and Abok), sexual and gender-based crimes committed against women abducted and placed in Ongwen's household, sexual and gender-based crimes committed against other women and girls within the Sinia Brigade (which Mr. Ongwen commanded), and the conscription and use of child soldiers.

On May 6, 2021, Mr. Ongwen was [sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1590)&nbsp;([summary](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/210506-ongwen-sentence-summary-eng.pdf)) to 25 years in prison. The Trial Chamber [considered](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2021_04230.PDF) the particular cruelty and discrimination (political and gender-based) of the crimes committed to be aggravated factors, and considered (to some extent) the mitigating personal circumstances of Mr. Ongwen's abduction as a child by the LRA. The Chamber rejected arguments of mitigating factors as to culpability.<br><br>There were 4,095 victims granted rights to participate in the proceedings, represented in two separate groups by legal representatives.&nbsp;

The next phases in the Ongwen case are appeal of the verdict and sentence (if pursued by the parties) and the opening of the reparations phase.<br><br>**More on the Ongwen trial (non-ABA resources):&nbsp;**<br>[ICC Case Information Sheet](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CaseInformationSheets/OngwenEng.pdf)<br>[Ongwen Trial Monitoring from International Justice Monitor](https://www.ijmonitor.org/category/lra-trials/)<br>[Human Rights Watch, Q&A: The LRA Commander Dominic Ongwen and the ICC](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/27/qa-lra-commander-dominic-ongwen-and-icc#)<br>[International Federation for Human Rights, Q&A on the Dominic Ongwen Case at the ICC](https://www.fidh.org/en/region/Africa/uganda/q-a-on-the-dominic-ongwen-case-at-the-icc)<br>[Open Society Justice Initiative, Briefing Paper, The Trial of Dominic Ongwen at the ICC: The Judgment&nbsp;](https://www.justiceinitiative.org/uploads/78c13cde-48e0-4ae4-9d6f-58e459998313/briefing-paper-dominic-ongwen-trial-judgment-20210202.pdf)<br>Asymmetrical Haircuts Podcast Episodes, [Justice Update: First LRA Verdict](https://www.asymmetricalhaircuts.com/episodes/justice-update-first-lra-verdict/), [Justice Update: End of the Road for Ongwen Trial](https://www.asymmetricalhaircuts.com/episodes/justice-update-end-of-the-road-for-ongwen-trial/), [Justice Update: Sarah Kasande on Ongwen at the ICC](https://www.asymmetricalhaircuts.com/episodes/justice-update-sarah-kasande-on-ongwen-at-the-icc/)<br>[Justice in Conflict Blog, Symposium, Life and Trials of Dominic Ongwen](https://justiceinconflict.org/2021/02/01/the-life-and-trials-of-dominic-ongwen-a-jic-symposium/)
