Pre-Trial Chamber III issued a sealed arrest warrant for Gbagbo on November 23, 2011, which was unsealed on November 30, 2011. Charges were confirmed against him on June 12, 2014. His case was joined with Charles Blé Goudé on March 11, 2015. The trial opened on January 28, 2016.

In an oral decision on January 15, 2019, Trial Chamber I [acquitted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1427) (by majority) both Gbagbo and Blé Goudé of all charges following presentation of the prosecution's case and defense motions for acquittal and "no case to answer". The Trial Chamber found that the prosecution had not adequately demonstrated through evidence the individual criminal responsibility of the defendants for crimes against humanity allegedly committed in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire in 2010 and 2011. The Trial Chamber [concluded](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/record.aspx?docNo=ICC-02/11-01/15-1263)&nbsp;that the prosecution's evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a common plan or policy to commit the crimes, a necessary contextual element in [crimes against humanity](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/crimes-against-humanity.shtml) under the Rome Statue. The Trial Chamber also found that "public speeches by Mr Gbagbo or Mr Blé Goudé constituted ordering, soliciting or inducing the alleged crimes or that either of the accused otherwise knowingly or intentionally contributed to the commission of such crimes." The defendants were [released with conditions](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1436) pending the appeal of this decision.&nbsp;

On March 31, 2021, the Appeals Chamber [confirmed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1583), by majority, the Trial Chamber's 2019 decision acquitting Mr Gbagbo or Mr Blé Goudé of all charges. The Appeals Chamber found no material error in the Trial Chambers' decision of acquittal and process, and rejected the Prosecutor's appeal.

The acquittal is now final.

The ICC authorized 727 persons to participate as victims in the Gbagbo and Blé Goudé proceedings. While reparations for victims are tied to a conviction or judicial proceeding and therefore will not be available for victims in this case, the Trust Fund for Victims might choose to implement [assistance programs](https://www.trustfundforvictims.org/index.php/en/what-we-do/assistance-programmes) in the future (as of March 2021, an assistance program for C&ocirc;te d’Ivoire was under construction).&nbsp;
