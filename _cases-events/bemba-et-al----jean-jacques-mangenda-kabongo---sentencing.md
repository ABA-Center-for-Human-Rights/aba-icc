Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo was sentenced to 2 yearsâ€™ imprisonment. The time that Mr. Mangenda spent previously in detention was deducted. The Chamber ordered the suspension of the operation of the remaining term of imprisonment for a period of 3 years so that the sentence shall not take effect unless during that period Mr. Mangenda commits another offence anywhere that is punishable with imprisonment.
