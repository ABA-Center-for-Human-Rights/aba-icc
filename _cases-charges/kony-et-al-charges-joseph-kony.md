### Factual Allegations

Joseph Kony is the founder and Commander in Chief of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The LRA allegedly operates as an army and is organized in a military hierarchy, divided into four brigades. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that in mid-2002, Kony began a campaign of brutalization, targeting civilians. In 2003, Kony allegedly ordered the LRA to attack Ugandan Army forces (UPDF) and to abduct civilians, including civilians living in internally displaced persons camps (IDP camps), in order to strengthen the LRA's numbers in Uganda. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Kony specifically ordered that LRA soldiers kill all civilians in certain regions of the Republic of Uganda, and that orders to loot and abduct civilians were standing orders and part of a consistent, larger strategy. In Kony's arrest warrant, the Office of the Prosecutor alleges that he ordered six specific attacks between 2002, when the ICC became operational, and 2004, when the Office of the Prosecutor began its investigation into the situation in the Republic of Uganda. These attacks were allegedly ordered or ratified by Kony, and included widespread killing and maiming of civilians, rape, and abducting civilians including children to serve as porters, sex slaves or soldiers in the LRA. Kony remains at large.
