### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Joseph Kony is Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Mr. Kony is, along with [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/) (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA) and other senior LRA commanders, a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

From 2002 to 2004, as alleged by the OTP, Mr. Kony planned and implemented six separate attacks in which Mr. Kony and senior LRA commanders armed and ordered LRA forces to do the following: to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians in certain regions and internally displaced camps of Uganda; to murder civilians; to rape and inflict sexual violence against civilians; to abduct and enslave civilians including children as forced laborers, forced fighters, and sexual slaves; and to pillage and destroy property. Mr. Kony’s ordered attacks included not only murder, rape, abduction, and enslavement, but also physical mutilations and physical beatings, forced marches and forced labor under threat of death, and mass burnings and lootings of homes.&nbsp;
