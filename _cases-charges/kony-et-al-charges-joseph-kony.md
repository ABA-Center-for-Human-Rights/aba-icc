### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Joseph Kony is Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Joseph Kony is, along with Vincent Otti (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA) and other senior LRA commanders, one of “the key members of “Control Altar,” the section representing the core LRA leadership responsible for devising and implementing LRA strategy, including standing orders to attack and brutalise civilian populations.”

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor further alleges that Joseph Kony “in his capacity as overall leader and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA. . . committed, ordered or induced the commission of several crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court during the period from 1 July 2002 to REDACTED 2004” and that, during that time period, Joseph Kony ordered six separate attacks in which he ordered LRA fighters: in 2002, to attack civilians in certain regions of Uganda; in 2003, to move into certain regions of Uganda to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians in certain regions of Uganda; in 2003, to abduct and enslave civilians including children as forced laborers, forced fighters, or forced sexual slaves; and in 2003, to kill civilians and pillage property in certain regions and certain internally displaced persons camps.&nbsp;

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor provides further details, based on its collected evidence, that Joseph Kony’s ordered attacks included not only murder, abduction, and enslavement, but also rape and sexual violence, physical mutilations and physical beatings, forced marches and forced labor under threat of death, and mass burnings and lootings of homes and camps.&nbsp;
