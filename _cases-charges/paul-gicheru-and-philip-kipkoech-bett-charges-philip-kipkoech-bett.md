### Factual Allegations

Philip Kipkoech Bett is suspected of offences against the administration of justice consisting in corruptly influencing Prosecution witnesses. <span class="redactor-invisible-space">The Prosecutor has provided 58 annexes containing documentary evidence, including a number of witness statements and transcripts of interviews, official documents and correspondence. The Prosecutor alleges, and the evidence demonstrates, that there has existed, from at least April 2013, a criminal scheme designed to systematically approach and corruptly influence witnesses of the Prosecutor through bribery and other methods of inducements in exchange for their withdrawal as prosecution witnesses and/or recantation of their prior statements to the Prosecutor.</span>

The evidence indicates that said scheme has been run in an organised manner and with a clear distribution of tasks. The role of Philip Kipkoech Bett has been to contact the witnesses, at least some of whom they knew previously, and to make initial proposals before bringing them to the managers.

There is also information that those witnesses who were successfully corrupted were enticed to make contact with other witnesses, for the purpose of their corruption.
