### Factual Allegations

Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi (Al-Islam) is the second eldest son of Muammar Gaddafi, ruler of Libya from 1969-2011. As a member of Gaddafi's inner circle, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Al-Islam played a key role in implementing Gaddafi's plan to suppress the February 2011 protests through any means necessary, including through lethal force. Al-Islam allegedly met with Al-Senussi and Gaddafi before the February 2011 protests to construct this plan, and conduct initial measures such as mobilizing Security Forces and recruiting foreign mercenaries. Al-Islam allegedly played an active role in recruiting these mercenaries, integrating them into the Security Forces, and in supporting the Security Forces organizationally. Throughout the uprising and ensuing conflict, Al-Islam appeared often on Libyan and international media. In these interviews, Al-Islam allegedly continually expressed the Gaddafi regime's control over Security Forces and willingness to use additional violence against protesters or civilians perceived as dissidents.
