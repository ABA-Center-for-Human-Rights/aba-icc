### Factual Allegations

Sylvestre Mudacumura is the Supreme Commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (*Forces D&eacute;mocratiques pour la Lib&eacute;ration du Rwanda*, FDLR). The FDLR is an armed group formed after the 1994 Rwandan Genocide that has been operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo throughout and in the aftermath of the first and second Congo wars. In 2009 and 2010, the FDLR allegedly engaged in an armed conflict against different groups in the Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that as a leader of the FDLR, Mudacumura agreed to conduct a campaign attacking civilian populations in order to create a human catastrophe which could strengthen the FDLR's attempt to extort political power from the international community. In his role as Commander of the FDLR, Mudacumura allegedly issued a general order to create a humanitarian catastrophe in the Kivus and ordered or approved several attacks against civilian populations where war crimes were committed.
