### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu (Babala) participated in a plan headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo to give monetary and other benefits to certain defense witnesses in exchange for their presentation of false testimony or evidence in *The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*. The OTP alleges that Babala was a close associate of Bemba's during Bemba's Vice Presidency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and served as his principal political advisor. The OTP also alleges that, as ordered by Bemba, Babala dispensed money to defense witnesses and their families, or to Jean-Jacques Magenda Kabongo and Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba so they could do so. He also allegedly participated in privileged conference calls with Bemba and Kilolo, spoke with Bemba in code about these financial transactions, and relayed instructions from Bemba to his family members.
