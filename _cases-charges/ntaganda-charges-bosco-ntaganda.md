### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Bosco Ntaganda was the Chief of Staff for Military Operations (December 2003 to 2005/2006) and the former Deputy Chief of Staff for Military Operations (September 2002 to December 2003) of the *Union des Patriotes Congolais*’s (UPC) military branch the *Forces Patriotiques pour la Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (FPLC). The OTP alleges that, though the UPC had a previously operating military wing, the UPC established the FPLC in September 2002, with [Thomas Lubanga Dyilo](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-lubanga/) as FPLC Commander‐in‐Chief, Floribert Kisembo as FPLC Chief of Staff, and Mr. Ntaganda as FPLC Deputy Chief of Staff. Mr. Ntaganda was in charge of developing and implementing military strategies, enlisting and training FPLC fighters, and issuing orders to FPLC fighters and disciplining noncompliance with his orders.

From 2002 to 2003, Mr. Ntaganda, as alleged by the OTP, armed and ordered FPLC forces to do the following: to murder civilians that were non-Hema (the Lendus, the Biras, and the Nandes) and those that supported the non-Hema (moderate Hemas) with the express purpose of evicting the non-Hema from the Ituri region; in particular, to target and murder the Lendus and drive them out of the Ituri region; to enlist children as forced fighters, bodyguards, escorts, and other armed personnel for FPLC forces, with female children fighters subject to rape and sexual violence by FPLC fighters; to rape and inflict sexual violence against men, women, and children as both a method of subjugating the local populace and rewarding FPLC fighters; and to destroy and pillage property. Mr. Ntaganda personally, as alleged by the OTP, did the following: murdered civilians and prisoners; with his bodyguards, abducted Lendu nuns and instructed his bodyguards to rape the nuns; pillaged homes, shops, churches, and hospitals for property for his own personal use; and enlisted children as forced fighters. Mr. Ntaganda also armed and instructed civilians to murder the Lendus.
