### Factual Allegations

Bosco Ntaganda is allegedly the Former Deputy Chief of General Staff for Military Operations and Commander of Operations of the Forces Patriotiques pour la Lib&eacute;ration du Congo (Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo - FPLC), one of several armed groups fighting for control of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between September 2002 and September 2003. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that in this role, Ntaganda was the third-highest rank in the FPLC, a subordinate of FPLC Commander-in-Chief Thomas Lubanga Dyilo (Lubanga), and allegedly controlled FPLC training camp and field commanders. In this role, Ntaganda was also allegedly involved in implementing decisions involving recruitment policy made at higher levels in the FPLC, including implementing the plan to recruit youth, including children under the age of 15, to participate in active hostilities as well as to do other tasks to support the FPLC. Once recruited whether voluntarily or through force, children under the age of 15 were sent to military training camps, and participated in hostilities in Libi, Mbau, Largu, Lipri, Bogoro, Bunia Djugu and Mongwalu. The OTP presented evidence that Ntaganda personally visited training camps where child soldiers were trained and participated in attacks where child soldiers also participated. These attacks by the UPC/FPLC were allegedly committed pursuant to an organizational policy to conduct a widespread and systematic campaign of attacks against the civilian population with the goal of controlling Ituri. This plan allegedly included the expulsion of rival ethnicities from the area, and encompassed the commission of murder, rape, sexual slavery and persecution on ethnic grounds committed against the non-Hema population.
