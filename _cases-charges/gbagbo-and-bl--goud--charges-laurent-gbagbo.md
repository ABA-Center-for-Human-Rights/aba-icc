### Factual Allegations

Laurent Gbagbo formed and led the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party and served as the President of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire from 2000-2010. His tenure as President spanned a sustained rebellion or civil war beginning in 2002, including government airstrikes against armed rebels in 2004 which resulted in the death of nine French soldiers. Gbagbo refused to hold elections until 2010. When his political opponent was elected, Gbagbo contested the election and refused to cede power. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Gbagbo and his inner circle had a plan to retain power by any means, and that Gbagbo and his supporters implemented this plan or policy by recruiting, arming, and later controlling militia groups and mercenaries instructed to carry out attacks against civilians perceived to support Ouattara. Gbagbo also allegedly used government-controlled media to fuel ethnic tensions, and to galvanize support for attacks against civilians and UN personnel in Côte d'Ivoire. Pro-Gbagbo forces allegedly conducted widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population in Abidjan and western Côte d'Ivoire which followed a similar pattern. In targeting civilians perceived to support Ouattara, pro-Gbagbo forces allegedly targeted civilians in specific ethnic or religious communities. OTP alleges that these attacks resulted in at least 3,000 deaths, 72 disappearances, and hundreds of cases of sexual violence and enforced disappearance. He is currently detained at the ICC Detention Centre in The Hague.
