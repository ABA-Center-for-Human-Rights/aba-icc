### Factual Allegations

Walter Osapiri Barasa is a journalist and previous intermediary between the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) and Kenyan witnesses in the investigation on the situation in the Republic of Kenya. Barasa allegedly corruptly influenced one Prosecution witness and attempted to corruptly influence two others, offering to pay them 1,000,000-1,500,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) each to withdraw their testimony. The OTP asserts that witness interference escalated in frequency and seriousness between May and July 2013. Barasa remains at large.

* He is alleged to have attempted to commit these crimes by taking action that commenced the execution by means of a substantial step, where the crime was not successfully committed due to circumstances independent of the Accused’s intentions ([Article 25(3)(f)](http://www.casematrixnetwork.org/case-m/klamberg-commentary/rome-statute/#c1198))
