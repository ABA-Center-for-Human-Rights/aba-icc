### Factual Allegations

Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled (Khaled) is the former Lieutenant General of the Libyan army and former head of the Libyan Internal Security Agency (ISA). The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that, in his capacity as the head of the ISA, Al-Tuhamy bears criminal responsibility for his participation in, contribution to, or role as a superior in widespread attacks carried out by Libyan security forces in 2011 against the civilian population, which included arresting, detaining, and mistreating perceived opponents of the Gaddafi regime. This mistreatment included severe beatings, electrocution, acts of sexual violence and rape, solitary confinement, deprivation of food and water, inhumane conditions of detention, mock executions, and threats of killing and rape.
