### Factual Allegations

*This case arises from the Accused's actions in connection with the case of [<u>The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</u>](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/), in which Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was charged, tried, and convicted of crimes against humanity (murder, rape) and war crimes (murder, rape, and pillaging) at the ICC.&nbsp;*

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was the head of a scheme to transfer financial compensation to defense witnesses in exchange for false testimony and false or forged documents\* favorable to the defense of Mr. Bemba in the case of [*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/). (\*Pre-Trial Chamber II declined to confirm the charge of false or forged documents.)

From 2011 to November 14, 2013, Mr. Bemba, as alleged by the OTP, made available financial resources and issued instructions to lead defense counsel [Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/aime-kilolo-musamba/), defense case manager [Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/jean-jacques-magenda-kabongo/), his former primary political advisor [Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/fid-le-babala-wandu/), and defense witness [Narcisse Arid](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/narcisse-arido/) with regard to contacting and scheduling defense witnesses, coaching of false statements to be made by defense witnesses, and the amounts of money to be given to defense witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;
