### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo (“Bemba”) was the President of the *Mouvement de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (MLC) and Commander-in-Chief of the MLC’s military branch *Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (ALC) (also referred to as “Banyamulengue” and “MLC”).&nbsp; Bemba formed and led MLC forces in a rebellion against the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&nbsp; Bemba also led MLC forces, in support of the government of the Central African Republic (CAR) headed by President Patass&eacute;, to attack rebel forces led by General Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute; and to inflict a campaign of murder, rape, and pillaging upon civilians suspected of supporting rebel forces.&nbsp; In 2008, Bemba was arrested and transferred to the ICC pursuant to the OTP’s case against Bemba ([*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/)). &nbsp; &nbsp;

Bemba, as alleged by the OTP, headed a scheme to transfer financial compensation to defense witnesses who gave false statements favorable to the defense of Bemba in the case against Bemba ([*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/)).&nbsp; In this scheme, Bemba made available financial resources and issued instructions to lead defense counsel [Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/aime-kilolo-musamba/), defense case manager [Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/jean-jacques-magenda-kabongo/), former primary political advisor [Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/fid-le-babala-wandu/), and close associate [Narcisse Arid](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/narcisse-arido/) with regard to financial amounts to be given to defense witnesses and coaching of false statements to be made by defense witnesses.&nbsp; Bemba circumvented the ICC’s monitored telephone system by calling his counsel and discussing the scheme during privileged attorney-client discussions or discussing the scheme with codes during non-privileged discussions.
