### Factual Allegations

Germain Katanga was the Commander of the Force de r&eacute;sistance patriotique en Ituri (FRPI), one of several armed groups fighting for political and military control of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Katanga was later appointed Brigadier-General of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC). Between August 2002 and May 2003, many armed groups as well as neighboring states engaged in a violent conflict to control natural resources in Ituri. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that the FNI and FRPI committed a joint attack on the village of Bogoro on February 24, 2003, and that as the leader of the FRPI, Germain Katanga led this attack and controlled other commanders responsible for the FNI. Katanga and his co-perpetrators allegedly directed the attack against civilians as well as the military camp that existed in Bogoro, pursuant to a plan to "wipe out" or "raze" Bogoro and its predominantly Hema civilian population. In implementing this plan, the attackers engaged in widespread killing and imprisonment, destroyed civilian homes, raped civilian women and girls, and prevented civilians from fleeing. Children under the age of 15 allegedly participated in the attack, which resulted in the death of 200 civilians. The FNI and FRPI allegedly also pillaged the property mainly of Hema civilians of Bogoro after the attack, and abducted women and girls from Bogoro and used them as "wives" of FNI and FRPI combatants. The OTP also alleged that Katanga personally used bodyguards who were under the age of 15.

The cases against Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui were originally joined, but were separated on November 21, 2012. Trial Chamber II [convicted](){: .cc-active} Katanga of murder as a crime against humanity and four counts of war crimes (murder, attacks against a civilian population, destruction of property and pillaging) on March 7, 2014, but acquitted him of other charges. He was found to be criminally responsible as an accessory within the meaning of a having otherwise contributed to the attack on Bogoro. On May 23, 2014, Trial Chamber II, ruling in the majority, [sentenced](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2085437.pdf) Germain Katanga to a total of 12 years' imprisonment. His sentence was then [reduced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/item.aspx?name=PR1174) on November 13, 2015.
