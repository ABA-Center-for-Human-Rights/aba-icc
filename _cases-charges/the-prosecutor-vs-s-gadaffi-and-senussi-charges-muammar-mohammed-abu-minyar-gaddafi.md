### Factual Allegations

Colonel Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi ruled Libya since seizing power in 1969, eventually renaming Libya the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamhiriya. Over his 40-year rule, Gaddafi instituted a legal and political regime which allowed him to rule with absolute power. Beginning in January 2011, Gaddafi allegedly began to plan for the possibility of popular protests in Libya after protests were initiated in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia. To this end, Gaddafi allegedly recruited foreign mercenaries to supplement his Security Forces, and planned a campaign to suppress future protests by all means, including through lethal force. This plan allegedly included the shooting of 500-700 protesters by Security Forces during the protests in February 2011. Pursuant to this plan and in order to maintain political power, Gaddafi allegedly ordered Security Forces to carry out widespread and systematic attacks against civilians that Gaddafi perceived as dissidents. According to information from human rights groups, Gaddafi's forces are allegedly responsible for incidents such as shootings of civilians leaving mosques on February 25, where some 100 people died, for air strikes in Tripoli, where some 228 people died, for bombings in Benghazi, where some 257 people died, and for air strikes and attacks by security forces in the towns of Misrata, Brega, Derna, Zenten, and Ajdabiya where at least 40 people allegedly died. Gaddafi was killed in October 2011 by members of a rebel militia.
