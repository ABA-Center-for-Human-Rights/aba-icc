### Factual Allegations

The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that the LRA operates as an army and is organized in a military hierarchy, divided into four brigades. Dominic Ongwen is allegedly the BrigadeCommander of the Sinia Brigade of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). As Brigade Commander, Ongwen is allegedly part of the "control altar" that receives and executes orders from LRA leader Joseph Kony. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that as part of this "control altar," Ongwen was involved in implementing larger LRA strategy, including issuing standing orders to attack, loot, and abduct civilians, and ordering to kill civilians in specific regions of the Republic of Uganda. In Ongwen's arrest warrant, the Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Ongwen acknowledged ordering one specific attack on an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in 2004 under orders from Kony. This attack included widespread killing and maiming of civilians, looting, and abducting civilians, including children, to serve as soldiers in the LRA.
