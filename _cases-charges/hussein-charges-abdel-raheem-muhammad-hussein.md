### Factual Allegations

Abdel Raheem Muhammad Hussein (Hussein) is the Minister of National Defense and former Minister of the Interior and the Sudanese President's Special Representative in Darfur. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that while Minister of the Interior and the Sudanese President's Special Representative in Darfur, Hussein was an influential member of the Government of the Republic of Sudan and coordinated the activities of different government bodies, security forces, and the militia/Janjaweed involved in counterinsurgency efforts. In 2003 and 2004, the Sudanese Armed Forces, the militias, and the Janjaweed allegedly carried out attacks against civilians in towns including Kodoom, Bindisi, Mukjar, Arawala, and surrounding areas, which the OTP alleges were devoid of insurgency activities at the time. Attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces, militias and Janjaweed often allegedly targeted civilians from the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit populations, and included murder, rape and sexual violence, pillaging, and destruction of civilian property. The OTP alleges that through this position and by his ability to participate in and exercise overall control of national, state and local security entities, Hussein played a key role in recruiting, arming, and funding the security forces, the Janjaweed, and the militias aligned with the Government of the Republic of Sudan. In so doing, Hussein allegedly contributed to the implementation by the Sudanese Armed Forces and the militia/Janjaweed of the common plan of the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to maintain security in Darfur by attacking civilian populations perceived to be associated with rebels. Hussein remains at large.
