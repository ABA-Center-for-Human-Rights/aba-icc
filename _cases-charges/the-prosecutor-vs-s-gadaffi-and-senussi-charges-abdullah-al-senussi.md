### Factual Allegations

Abdullah Al-Senussi is the brother-in-law of Muammar Gaddafi, ruler of Libya from 1969- 2011. As a member of Gaddafi's inner circle, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Al-Senussi played a key role in implementing Gaddafi's pan to suppress the February 2011 protests through any means necessary, including through lethal force. Al-Senussi allegedly met with Al-Islam and Gaddafi before the February 2011 protests to construct this plan, and conduct initial measures such as mobilizing Security Forces and recruiting foreign mercenaries. The OTP alleges that Senussi commanded Security Forces during the uprising, and that Al-Senussi functioned as Gaddafi's "executioner." Senussi allegedly directed the Security Forces' attack on civilian protestors in Benghazi and ordered Security Forces to shoot civilians.
