### Factual Allegations

Thomas Lubanga Dyilo (Lubanga) was the President of the Union des Patriotes Congolais (Union of Congolese Patriots, UPC), as well as Commander-in-Chief and political leader of its armed wing, the Force patriotique pour la lib&eacute;ration du Congo (Patriotic Force for the Liberation of Congo - FPLC). The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that the UPC/FPLC controlled Ituri beginning in September 2002, and were involved in an armed conflict against Lendu militias including the Arm&eacute;e Populaire Congolaise (APC) and the Force de R&eacute;sistance Patriotique en Ituri (FRPI), between September 2002 and August 2003. As leader of the UPC/FPLC, Lubanga had an overall coordinating role in planning its activities and operations, played a critical role in providing logistical support to the FPLC troops. Lubanga was also involved in making decisions involving recruitment policy and along with co-perpetrators, participated in establishing a common plan to build an army for the purpose of gaining and maintaining political and military control over Ituri. In implementing this plan, the UPC/FPLC engaged in widespread recruitment of youth including children under the age of 15 to participate in active hostilities as well as to do other tasks to support the UPC/FPLC. Once recruited voluntarily or through force, children under the age of 15 were sent to military training camps, and were deployed as soldiers in Bunia, Tchomia, Kasenyi, and Bogoro and took part in fighting in areas including Kobu, Songolo, and Mongbwalu. The UPC/FPLC used children as military guards and to compose a special "Kadogo Unit" whose ranks were primarily children. The OTP presented evidence that Lubanga personally made speeches encouraging children under the age of 15 to join the UPC/FPLC and personally used bodyguards who were under the age of 15.
