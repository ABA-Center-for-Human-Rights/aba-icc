### Factual Allegations

The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that the LRA operates as an army and is organized in a military hierarchy, divided into four brigades. Raska Lukwiya allegedly was the Brigade General and Deputy Army Commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), and was later promoted to Army Commander. As Army Commander, Lukwiya was allegedly part of the "control altar" that received and executed orders from LRA leader Joseph Kony. OTP alleges that as part of this "control altar," Lukwiya was involved in implementing the larger LRA strategy, including issuing standing orders to attack, loot, and abduct civilians, and ordering to kill civilians in specific regions of the Republic of Uganda. In Lukwiya's arrest warrant, OTP alleges that while in his capacity as Deputy Army Commander, Lukwiya received orders from Otti and then proceeded to order one specific attack on an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in 2003. This attack allegedly included killing of civilians, looting, and abducting civilians to serve as soldiers in the LRA. Lukwiya was killed in a confrontation with the Ugandan Army on August 12, 2006, and after DNA tests confirmed his identity, Pretrial Chamber II [terminated](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc297945.pdf) the case against him on July 11, 2007.
