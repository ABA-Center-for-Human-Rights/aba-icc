### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Raska Lukwiya was the Army Commander (third in command), former Deputy Army Commander, and former Brigade General of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Mr. Lukwiya was, along with [Joseph Kony](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/joseph-kony/) (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/) (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA), a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

Under Mr. Kony's orders, as alleged by the OTP, Mr. Lukwiya armed and ordered LRA forces to do the following: to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians in certain regions and internally displaced camps of Uganda; to murder civilians; to abduct and enslave civilians including children as forced laborers, forced fighters, and sexual slaves; and to pillage and destroy property.

In October 2006, at the request of the Government of Uganda and the OTP, the Netherlands Ministry of Justice-Forensics Institute reported its conclusion that the remains of the person killed on August 12, 2006 was that of Mr. Lukwiya, and the Government of Uganda provided notice that, in addition to DNA testing, there was body identification by Mr. Lukwiya’s family members and confirmation of death by LRA command. On July 11, 2007, Pre-Trial Chamber II terminated proceedings against Mr. Lukwiya.
