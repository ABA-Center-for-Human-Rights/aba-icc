### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that Raska Lukwiya was the Army Commander (third in command), former Deputy Army Commander, and former Brigade General of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Raska Lukwiya was, along with [Joseph Kony](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/joseph-kony/) (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/)(Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA), a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

Under Joseph Kony's orders, as alleged by OTP, Raska Lukwiya moved with LRA fighters into certain regions to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians; ordered LRA fighters to kill civilians and pillage property in an internally displaced persons camp; and ordered LRA fighters to abduct and enslave civilians as forced laborers to carry looted property.&nbsp;

In October 2006, the Netherlands Ministry of Justice-Forensics Institute, at the request of the Government of Uganda and the ICC Prosecutor, prepared a report that concluded that the remains of the person killed on August 12, 2006 was that of Raska Lukwiya, and the Government of Uganda provided notice that, in addition to the DNA testing, there was body identification by Lukwiya’s family members and former LRA members and confirmation of death by LRA command.&nbsp; On July 11, 2007, Pre-Trial Chamber II terminated proceedings against Raska Lukwiya.
