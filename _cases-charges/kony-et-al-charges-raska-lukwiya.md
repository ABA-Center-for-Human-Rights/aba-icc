### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor charged that Raska Lukwiya was “the Army Commander [third in command] who formerly occupied the posts of Brigade General and Deputy Army Commander” of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Raska Lukwiya was, along with Joseph Kony (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and Vincent Otti (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA), one of “the key members of “Control Altar,” the section representing the core LRA leadership responsible for devising and implementing LRA strategy, including standing orders to attack and brutalise civilian populations.”

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor further charged that, under Kony’s orders, Raska Lukwiya: moved with LRA fighters into certain regions to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians; ordered LRA fighters to kill civilians and pillage property from internally displaced persons camp; and ordered LRA fighters to abduct and enslave civilians as forced laborers to carry looted property.&nbsp;

In October 2006, the Netherlands Ministry of Justice-Forensics Institute, at the request of the Government of Uganda and the ICC Prosecutor, prepared a report that concluded that the remains of the person killed on August 12, 2006 was that of Raska Lukwiya, and the Government of Uganda provided notice that, in addition to the DNA testing, there was body identification by Lukwiya’s family members and former LRA members and confirmation of death by LRA command.&nbsp; On July 11, 2007, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II terminated proceedings against Raska Lukwiya.
