### Factual Allegations

Ahmad Muhammad Harun (Harun) is the Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs of the Republic of Sudan, and the former Minister of State for the Interior of the Government of Sudan. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that while Harun acted as the Minister of State for the Interior he managed the Darfur Security Desk, which coordinated the activities of different government bodies and security forces, as well as the Janjaweed and militia involved in counterinsurgency efforts. In 2003 and 2004, the Sudanese Armed Forces, the militias, and the Janjaweed allegedly carried out attacks against civilians in towns including Kodoom, Bindisi, Mukjar, Arawala, and surrounding areas, which the OTP alleges were devoid of insurgency activities at the time. Attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces, militias, and Janjaweed often allegedly targeted civilians from the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit populations, and included murder, rape and sexual violence, pillaging, and destruction of civilian property. The OTP alleges that through his governmental position and his ability to participate in and exercise overall control of the Security Committees, Harun played a key role in recruiting, arming, and funding the Janjaweed and the militias aligned with the Government of the Republic of Sudan. In so doing, Harun allegedly contributed to the implementation by the Sudanese Armed Forces and the militia/Janjaweed of the common plan of the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to maintain security in Darfur by attacking civilian populations perceived to be associated with rebels. Harun remains at large.
