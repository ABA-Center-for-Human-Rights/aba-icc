### Factual Allegations

Charles Blé Goudé was the Patriots and Minister for Youth, Professional Training and Employment and President of the Congress of the Young People. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Blé Goudé was a member of Gbagbo's inner circle and attended and participated in meetings where Gbagbo and his close advisors discussed their plan to retain Gbagbo's power by all means. Blé Goudé allegedly gave political advice to Gbagbo, received instructions from him, and allegedly discussed his approval of the common plan to instruct pro-Gbagbo forces to attack civilians perceived to support Ouattara, often targeting civilians in specific ethnic or religious communities. He allegedly played a key role in recruiting and arming pro-Gbagbo youth militias which were integrated into the Ivorian Defense and Security Forces (FDS). The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Blé Goudé had the ability to control and command the youth of militias and the FDS. He allegedly gave a speech where he called on the Young Patriots to "defend the country against foreigners and foreign peacekeepers," which proceeded several attacks on civilians and peacekeepers.
