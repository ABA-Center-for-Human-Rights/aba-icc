### Factual Allegations

Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was the President and Commander-in-chief of the Mouvement de lib&eacute;ration du Congo (Movement for the Liberation of Congo, MLC). The President of the Central African Republic (CAR), allied with the Mouvement de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo (MLC) led by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo confronted a rebel movement led by Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute; in the process of the armed conflict from October 26, 2002 to March 15, 2003. The MLC forces are alleged to have committed crimes against the civilian population including rape, murder, and pillaging, and produced a significant number of civilian victims. Bemba is alleged to have acted as a military commander and have had effective authority and control over the MLC troops that committed the crimes. Allegedly, he knew that MLC troops were committing crimes and did not take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or repress their commission.
