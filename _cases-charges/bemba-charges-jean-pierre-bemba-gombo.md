### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo (“Bemba”) was the President of the *Mouvement de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (MLC) and Commander-in-Chief of the MLC’s military branch *Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (ALC) (also referred to as “Banyamulengue” and “MLC”).&nbsp; Bemba formed and led the MLC in a rebellion against the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&nbsp; In the struggle for control of the Central African Republic (CAR) between President Ange‐F&eacute;lix Patass&eacute; and former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces General Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, which began when General Boziz&eacute; led a rebellion against President Patass&eacute;, Bemba’s MLC forces supported President Patass&eacute;.&nbsp; Bemba and President Patass&eacute; made an agreement that MLC forces would support the government of the CAR as headed by President Patass&eacute; in exchange for the government of the CAR not supporting the government of the DRC.&nbsp;

From 2002 to 2003, as alleged by the OTP, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo ordered MLC forces: to cross Ubangui River and enter the Central African Republic from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to attack and murder General Boziz&eacute;’s forces in various areas of the Central African Republic; to attack and murder civilians; to commit rapes and sexual violence against civilians; and to pillage property from civilians and murder those who resisted.&nbsp; In a systematic and widespread campaign against civilians, MLC forces murdered, beat, and raped men, women, and children.&nbsp;
