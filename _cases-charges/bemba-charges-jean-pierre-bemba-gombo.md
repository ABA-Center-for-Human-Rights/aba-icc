### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was the President of the *Mouvement de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (MLC) and Commander-in-Chief of the MLC’s military branch *Arm&eacute;e de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo* (MLC/ALC); Mr. Bemba formed and led the MLC in a rebellion against the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The OTP alleges that, in the struggle for control of the Central African Republic (CAR) between President Ange‐F&eacute;lix Patass&eacute; and former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces General Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, Mr. Bemba and President Patass&eacute; made an agreement that MLC forces would support CAR government forces in exchange for the CAR government not supporting the DRC government.

From 2002 to 2003, as alleged by the OTP, Mr. Bemba armed and ordered MLC forces to do the following: to enter the CAR from the DRC and to attack General Boziz&eacute;’s rebel forces and civilians in various areas of the CAR; to murder civilians; to commit rape and inflict sexual violence against men, women, and children as a method of terrorizing and subjugating the local populace; and to pillage and destroy property.&nbsp;
