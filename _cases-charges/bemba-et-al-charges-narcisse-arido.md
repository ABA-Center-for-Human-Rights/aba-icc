### Factual Allegations

The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Narcisse Arido (Arido) participated in a plan headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo to give monetary and other benefits to certain defense witnesses in exchange for their presentation of false testimony or evidence in The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. The Office of the Prosecutor alleges that Arido provided false or forged evidence, which the defense attempted to put into the record. Arido also allegedly received money transfers from Aimé Kilolo and Fidèle Babala with funds made available by Bemba, which were used to pay defense witnesses. Arido was granted interim release from detention at the ICC Detention Center in The Hague on 21 October 2014 and was subsequently released from custody.
