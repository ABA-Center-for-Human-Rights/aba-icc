### Factual Allegations

*This case arises from the Accused’s actions in connection with the case of [<u>The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</u>,](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/) in which Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was charged, tried, and convicted of crimes against humanity (murder, rape) and war crimes (murder, rape, and pillaging) at the ICC.&nbsp;*

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that defense case manager Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo was a liaison between Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo and lead defense counsel [Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/aime-kilolo-musamba/) in a scheme, devised by Mr. Bemba, to transfer financial compensation to defense witnesses in exchange for false testimony and false or forged documents\* favorable to the defense of Mr. Bemba in the case of [*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/).&nbsp; (\*Pre-Trial Chamber II declined to confirm the charge of false or forged documents.)

From 2011 to November 14, 2013, Mr. Mangenda, as alleged by the OTP, relayed messages between Mr. Bemba and Mr. Kikolo with regard to scheduling and contacting witnesses, coaching of testimonies of witnesses, and transfer of money to witnesses.
