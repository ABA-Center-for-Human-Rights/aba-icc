### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Jean-Jacques Magenda Kabongo (Magenda) participated in a plan headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo to give monetary and other benefits to certain defense witnesses in exchange for their presentation of false testimony or evidence in The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. The OTP alleges Magenda and Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba were the individuals mostly responsible for the scheme's implementation. In so doing, Magenda allegedly received money transfers with funds made available by Bemba, which may have been used to pay defense witnesses. He allegedly worked with Kilolo to contact defense witnesses before, after, and sometimes during their testimony to coach them on how to answer the questions they would be asked in court, and allegedly participated in privileged conference calls with Bemba and Fid&egrave;le Babala.
