### Factual Allegations

Vincent Otti is allegedly the Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that the LRA operates as an army and is organized in a military hierarchy, divided into four brigades, and that as Second-in-Command, Otti is part of the "control altar" that receives and executes orders from LRA leader Joseph Kony. OTP alleges that as part of this "control altar," Otti is responsible for creating and implementing larger LRA strategy, including issuing standing orders to attack, loot, and abduct civilians, and orders to kill civilians in specific regions of the Republic of Uganda. When Kony was based in Southern Sudan, Otti allegedly served as his "Commander of the LRA for its operations in Uganda," and functioned as an intermediary between Kony and other LRA leaders. In Otti's arrest warrant, OTP alleges that he ordered six specific attacks between 2002, when the ICC became operational, and 2004, when OTP began its investigation into the situation in the Republic of Uganda. These attacks were allegedly ordered, induced or ratified by Otti, and included widespread killing and maiming of civilians, rape, and abducting civilians including children to serve as porters, sex slaves or soldiers in the LRA. Kony allegedly reported that Otti was dead in 2008, but the OTP considers Otti to be at large, and he remains a defendant in The Prosecutor v. Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odihambo and Dominic Ongwen.
