### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Vincent Otti is Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Vincent Otti is, along with Joseph Kony (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and other senior LRA commanders, a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

From 2002 to 2004, Vincent Otti, as alleged by the OTP, shared with Joseph Kony the responsibility for six separate attacks in which Vincent Otti ordered LRA fighters: to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians in certain regions and certain internally displaced camps of Uganda; to abduct and enslave civilians including children as forced laborers, forced fighters, or forced sexual slaves; and to kill civilians and pillage property in certain regions and certain internally displaced persons camps. Vincent Otti’s ordered attacks included not only murder, abduction, and enslavement, but also rape and sexual violence, physical mutilations and physical beatings, forced marches and forced labor under threat of death, and mass burnings and lootings of homes and camps.&nbsp;
