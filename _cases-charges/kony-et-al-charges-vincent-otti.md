### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Vincent Otti is Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Vincent Otti is, along with Joseph Kony (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and other senior LRA commanders, a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor further alleges that Vincent Otti “as the Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA, shared with Joseph Kony the task of setting out the LRA objectives and acted as “Kony’s commander of the LRA for its operations in Uganda” from REDACTED 2003 to REDACTED 2004, when Joseph Kony was based in southern Sudan” and that Vincent Otti “in his capacity as Second-in-Command to the LRA’s Chairman and Commander-in-Chief Joseph Kony, . . . ordered or induced the commission of several crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court during the period from 1 July, 2002 to REDACTED 2004.” &nbsp;

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor further alleges that, during that time period, Vincent Otti shares criminal responsibility with Joseph Kony for six separate attacks in which Vincent Otti explained the objectives and strategies of the attacks, issued orders on the timing and execution of the attacks, and received reports from subordinates who committed the attacks.

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor provides further details, based on collected evidence, that Vincent Otti’s ordered attacks included not only murder, abduction, and enslavement, but also rape and sexual violence, physical mutilations and physical beatings, forced marches and forced labor under threat of death, and mass burnings and lootings of homes and camps.&nbsp;

In January 2008, Reuters reported that South Sudan Vice President Riek Machard said [that he had been informed by Joseph Kony that Vincent Otti was dead](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL23695656); BBC News reported that [Vincent Otti may have been executed on Joseph Kony’s orders](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7083311.stm).&nbsp; However, as of June 2016, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor has not requested termination of proceedings against Vincent Otti.&nbsp;
