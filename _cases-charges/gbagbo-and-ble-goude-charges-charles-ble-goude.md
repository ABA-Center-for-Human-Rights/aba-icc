### Factual Allegations

Charles Bl&eacute; Goud&eacute; was the President of the Congress of the Young People and the Patriots (COJEP). The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Bl&eacute; Goud&eacute; was a member of Gbagbo's inner circle and attended and participated in meetings where Gbagbo and his close advisors discussed their plan to retain Gbagbo's power by any means. Bl&eacute; Goud&eacute; allegedly gave political advice to Gbagbo, received instructions from him, and discussed his approval of the common plan to instruct pro-Gbagbo forces to attack civilians perceived to support Ouattara, often targeting civilians in specific ethnic or religious communities. He allegedly played a key role in recruiting and arming pro-Gbagbo youth militias which were integrated into the Ivorian Defense and Security Forces (FDS). The OTP alleges that Bl&eacute; Goud&eacute; had the ability to control and command the youth of militias and the FDS. He allegedly gave a speech where he called on the Young Patriots to "defend the country against foreigners and foreign peacekeepers," which proceeded several attacks on civilians and peacekeepers.
