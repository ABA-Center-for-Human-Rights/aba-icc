### Factual Allegations

The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that the LRA operates as an army and is organized in a military hierarchy, divided into four brigades. Okot Odhiambo was allegedly the Brigade Commander of Trinkle Brigade, Stockree Brigade, and later the Deputy Army Commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). As Deputy Army Commander, Odhiambo is allegedly part of the "control altar" that receives and executes orders from LRA leader Joseph Kony. OTP alleges that, as part of this "control altar," Odhiambo was involved in implementing the larger LRA strategy, including issuing standing orders to attack, loot, and abduct civilians, and orders to kill civilians in specific regions of the Republic of Uganda. In Odhiambo's arrest warrant, OTP alleges that he ordered two specific attacks between 2002, when the ICC became operational, and 2004, when OTP began its investigation into the situation in the Republic of Uganda. These attacks were allegedly ordered, induced or ratified by Odhiambo, and included widespread killing and maiming of civilians, looting, and abducting civilians, including children, to serve as soldiers in the LRA. In implementing these attacks, OTP alleges that Odhiambo was considered a particularly ruthless killer and commander, and that he was promoted by Kony following the completion of one particularly violent attack.

Odhiambo's body was discovered in April 2015; he was suspected to have died as a result of an attack by the Ugandan military while patrolling in the Central African Republic in October 2013. On 10 September 2015, Pre-trial Chamber II [terminated](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200204/related%20cases/icc%200204%200105/court%20records/chambers/pre%20trial%20chamber%20ii/Pages/431.aspx) proceedings against the alleged Odhiambo following the forensic confirmation of his passing.
