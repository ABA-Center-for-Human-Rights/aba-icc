### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that Okot Odhiambo was Deputy Army Commander and former Brigade Commander of Trinkle and Stockree Brigades of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Okot Odhiambo was, along with [Joseph Kony](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/joseph-kony/) (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/) (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA), a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

Under Joseph Kony’s orders, as alleged by the OTP, Okot Odhiambo moved with LRA fighters into certain regions to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians; ordered LRA fighters to kill civilians and pillage property in an internally displaced persons camp; ordered LRA fighters to abduct and enslave civilians as forced laborers to carry looted property; and ordered LRA fighters to abduct and enlist children as LRA fighters.

In March 2015, the Government of Uganda exhumed a corpse which was identified through DNA testing as that of Okot Odhiambo and certified that Okot Odhiambo died on October 27, 2013.&nbsp; On September 7, 2015, Pre-Trial Chamber II terminated proceedings against Okot Odhiambo.
