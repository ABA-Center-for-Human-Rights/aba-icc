### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Okot Odhiambo was Deputy Army Commander and former Brigade Commander of Trinkle and Stockree Brigades of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and that Mr. Odhiambo was, along with [Joseph Kony](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/joseph-kony/) (Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the LRA) and [Vincent Otti](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/vincent-otti/) (Vice-Chairman and Second-in-Command of the LRA), a member of the “Control Altar,” which is the leadership group that conceived of, planned, and implemented LRA strategy which included campaigns to attack civilian settlements and standing orders to attack, abduct, and loot civilians.&nbsp;

Under Mr. Kony's orders, as alleged by the OTP, Mr. Odhiambo instructed and armed LRA forces to do the following: to attack Ugandan government forces and civilians in certain regions and internally displaced camps of Uganda; to murder civilians; to abduct and enslave civilians including children as forced laborers, forced fighters, and sexual slaves; and to pillage property in certain regions and internally displaced persons camps.&nbsp;

In March 2015, the Government of Uganda exhumed a corpse which was identified through DNA testing as that of Mr. Odhiambo and certified that Mr. Odhiambo died on October 27, 2013. On September 7, 2015, Pre-Trial Chamber II terminated proceedings against Mr. Odhiambo.
