### Factual Allegations

Kenyatta and members of the Mungiki (a criminal organization) allegedly developed and executed a common plan to attack perceived ODM supporters in order to keep the Party of National Unity (PNU) in power in the 2007-2008 elections. In executing the common plan, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Muthuara facilitated meetings with Kenyatta and members of the Mungiki in order to prepare widespread attacks against civilians perceived to support ODM, and to instruct Kenyan Police Forces not to interfere with the movement of pro-PNU and Mungiki members. Muthuara allegedly helped to facilitate post-election attacks by providing transportation, funding, weapons, and logistical support to the direct perpetrators. As Chairman of the National Security Committee, and with support from Ali (former Police Commissioner and member of the National Security Committee), Muthuara allegedly further ensured the attackers' safe travel across Kenya, ensured that police did not interfere with their travel, and ensured that attackers were not punished after the attacks.
