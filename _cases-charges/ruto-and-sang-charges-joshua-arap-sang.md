### Factual Allegations

Along with Henry Kiprono Kosgey and William Samoei Ruto, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Sang established a network in 2006 which he later used to commit crimes directed against supporters of the Party of National Unity (PNU). Sang, a prominent Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) supporter, allegedly used his radio program to allow Ruto's network to organize meetings, and broadcasted hateful messages furthering ethnic tensions and instructions during the post-election attacks.

After the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared on December 30, 2007 that incumbent PNU candidate Mwai Kibaki had won the presidential election, thousands of members of the network allegedly began to attack PNU supporters in Turbo, Huruma, Kimumu, Langas, Yamumbi, Kapsabet and Nandi Hills. They allegedly burnt down the houses of political opponents, killed civilians and forced them out of their homes. On January 1, 2008, at least 17 people died in an incident where network members allegedly burnt down a church in Kiambaa with more than 100 people inside. The attacks continued into the first week of January 2008.
