### Factual Allegations

Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui (Ngudjolo) was allegedly one of three Commanders of the Front des nationalistes et int&eacute;grationnistes (Allied Forces of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front, FNI), one of several armed groups fighting for political and military control of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between August 2002 and May 2003, many armed groups as well as neighboring states engaged in a violent conflict to control natural resources in Ituri. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleged that as the highest ranking commander of the FNI, Ngudjolo played an essential role in the planning and the implementation of an attack against Bogoro village in Ituri, on or around February 24, 2003, together with commanders of the FRPI, including Germain Katanga. The OTP alleged that Ngudjolo and commanders directed the attack against civilians as well as the military camp that existed in Bogoro, pursuant to a plan to "wipe out" or "raze" Bogoro and its predominantly Hema civilian population. In implementing this plan, the attackers engaged in widespread killing and imprisonment, destroyed civilian homes, raped civilian women and girls, and prevented civilians from fleeing. Children under the age of 15 allegedly participated in the attack, which resulted in the death of 200 civilians. The FNI and FRPI allegedly also pillaged the property mainly of Hema civilians of Bogoro after the attack, and abducted women and girls from Bogoro and used them as "wives" of FNI and FRPI combatants.
