##### Background

Name: William Samoei Ruto

Title: Deputy President of the Republic of Kenya

Case Status: Trial Ongoing

Charges: **Crime against humanity (3 counts)**: murder, forcible transfer of population and persecution; criminal responsibility as having committed the crime as an individual or jointly or through another.


#### Factual Allegations

Along with Henry Kiprono Kosgey and Joshua Arap Sang, Ruto allegedly established a network in 2006 which he later used to commit crimes directed against supporters of the Party of National Unity (PNU). During the 2007 election, Ruto was allegedly perceived as an elder or leader in the Kalinjen community (which participated with the Orange Democratic Movement). The confirmation of charges alleges that he gave oral and written orders for others to carry out killings and forced displacements of perceived PNU supporters in several towns.

After the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared on 30 December 2007 that incumbent PNU candidate Mwai Kibaki had won the presidential election, thousands of members of the network allegedly began to attack PNU supporters in Turbo, Huruma, Kimumu, Langas, Yamumbi, Kapsabet and Nandi Hills. They allegedly burnt down the houses of political opponents, killed civilians and forced them out of their homes. On 1 January 2008, at least 17 people died in an incident where network members allegedly burnt down a church in Kiambaa with more than 100 people inside. The attacks continued into the first week of January 2008.
