Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine gained its independence, taking with it the Crimean peninsula. On November 21, 2013, protests erupted in Ukraine as a result of President Yanukovych's decision not to sign an agreement for Ukraine to join with the European Union. Over the weeks that protests continued, violent clashes between protesters and security forces increased. In the first three months of protests, an estimated 118 people were killed as a result of the violence.

On April 9, 2014, Ukraine made an Article 12(3) declaration accepting ICC jurisdiction from November 30, 2013 - February 22, 2014. On April 25, 2014, the Office of the Prosecutor announced publicly that a Preliminary Examination in Ukraine was already underway. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Assessment stage.

On September 8, 2015, the Government of Ukraine lodged a second declaration under article 12(3) of the Statute accepting the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC in relation to alleged crimes committed on its territory from February 20, 2014 onwards, with no end date. On 29 September, the Prosecutor [announced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1156.aspx), based on Ukraineâ€™s second declaration under article 12(3), the extension of the preliminary examination of the situation in Ukraine to include alleged crimes occurring after February 20, 2014.
