Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine gained its independence, taking with it the Crimean peninsula. On November 21, 2013, [protests erupted](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/protests-continue-as-ukraine-leader-defends-stance-on-europe.html) in Ukraine as a result of [President Yanukovych](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182830)'s decision [not to sign an agreement](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/world/europe/ukraine-refuses-to-free-ex-leader-raising-concerns-over-eu-talks.html) for Ukraine to join the European Union and achieve greater economic integration. Over the weeks of protests that ensued, violent clashes between protesters and security forces increased. In the first three months of protests, an estimated 118 people were [killed](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/ukraine-dead-protesters-police) as a result of the violence. In early 2014, the State saw a significant increase in fighting between Ukranian forces and Russian-backed rebels around Donetsk. The crisis between Russia and Ukraine over the annexation of Crimea heightened tensions and resulted in the [deaths](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52771#.V18XbudUMt8) of 9,000 and the injury of 21,000 locals.

Ukraine is not a State Party to the Rome Statute. On April 17, 2014, Ukraine made a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/997/declarationRecognitionJuristiction09-04-2014.pdf) under Article 12(3) [accepting ICC jurisdiction](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr997&amp;ln=en) from November 30, 2013 through February 22, 2014. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr999) of a preliminary examination on April 25, 2014.

On September 8, 2015, the government lodged a second Article 12(3) [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1146) accepting the ICC’s jurisdiction in relation to alleged crimes committed on its territory from February 20, 2014 onwards with no end date. On September 29, 2015, the Prosecutor [announced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press and media/press releases/Pages/pr1156.aspx), based on Ukraine’s second declaration, the extension of the preliminary examination of the situation in Ukraine to include alleged crimes occurring after February 20, 2014. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) is currently in phase 2, the subject-matter jurisdiction stage.
