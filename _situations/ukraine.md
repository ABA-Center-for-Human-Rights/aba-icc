**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Ukraine focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during the following related situations. (1) The 2014 Ukrainian political crisis, also known as the Maidan protests, involved Ukrainian government forces (under President Viktor Yanukovych) and pro-European anti-government protesters. (2) The 2014 Ukraine-Crimea separatist conflict involved Ukrainian government forces (under acting President Oleksandr Turchinov), Russian government forces, and pro-Russian anti-government armed groups. (3) The 2014 Ukraine-Donetsk-Luhansk separatist conflict, which includes the shooting down of (civilian) Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, similarly involved Ukrainian government forces (under President Petro Poroshenko), Russian government forces, and pro-Russian anti-government armed groups. The 2014 Ukrainian political crisis occurred between November 21, 2013 and February 22, 2014, and the Ukrainian separatist conflicts with Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk occurred from February 20, 2014 to the present.&nbsp;

(1) In late November 2013, under [economic pressure](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/world/europe/ukraine-refuses-to-free-ex-leader-raising-concerns-over-eu-talks.html) from Russia, President Yanukovych [announced](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-eu-idUSBRE9AR0CL20131129) that Ukraine would not sign an association agreement with the European Union, which sparked a political crisis that led to the ousting of President Yanukovich. In early December 2013, 350,000 pro-European anti-government protesters [gathered in Kiev Independence Square](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-protest-idUSBRE9AT01Q20131201) (Maidan) and [occupied Kiev City Hall](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-eu-cityhall-idUSBRE9B007B20131201). In late February 2014, after months of violent clashes between Ukrainian government forces and protesters, the violence sharply escalated with police snipers shooting at protesters and, in two days, an estimated [75 killed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-idUSBREA1G0OU20140220) to [100 killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/world/europe/ukraine.html). On February 21, 2014, President Yanukovych and opposition leaders agreed to a [peace deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/world/europe/ukraine.html) which limited presidential powers and scheduled new presidential elections.&nbsp; On February 22, 2014, Ukraine Parliament [removed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-idUSBREA1G0OU20140222) President Yanukovych from office; President Yanukovych [claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/europe/ukraine.html) he had been forced to leave by a coup.&nbsp;

(2) The removal of President Yanukovych subsequently inflamed separatist movements in eastern Ukraine—Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk. On February 27-28, 2014, pro-Russian armed groups and Russian government forces [occupied](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-idUSBREA1P23U20140227) Crimean government buildings, including the Crimean parliament building, and [seized](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-idUKBREA1H0EM20140228) Crimean airports, including a Sevastopol military airport and a Simferopol civilian international airport. On March 6, 2014, the Crimean parliament [voted](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/world/europe/ukraine.html) to secede from Ukraine and to join Russia. On March 16, 2014, in a referendum, Crimean voters [supported](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/world/europe/crimea-ukraine-secession-vote-referendum.html) secession from Ukraine and union with Russia. On March 18, 2014, Russia [annexed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html) Crimea.

(3) On April 6, 2014, pro-Russian armed groups [occupied](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-storm-idUSBREA350B420140406) government buildings in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv. Ukraine regained control of Kharkiv but has not been able to regain control of Donetsk and Luhansk. On May 11, 2014, in respective referendums, Donetsk and Luhansk voters [s](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/world/europe/ukraine-referendum.html)upported secession from Ukraine. On May 26, 2014, the day after President [Poroshenko](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/world/europe/ukraine-elections.html) was elected, pro-Russian armed groups [seized](http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-airport-idUKBREA4P03720140526) Donetsk civilian international airport, and Ukraine [launched](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA4M05420140527) airstrikes against the pro-Russian armed groups. On July 14, 2014, pro-Russian armed groups [shot down](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/europe/ukrainian-military-plane-is-shot-down-as-russia-adds-to-presence-at-border.html) another Ukrainian military transport jet over Luhansk, and Ukraine [launched](http://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-idUKL6N0PP1LX20140714) airstrikes against pro-Russian armed groups that had seized Luhansk civilian international airport.&nbsp;

On July 17, 2014, pro-Russian armed groups [shot down](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/malaysian-airlines-plane-ukraine.html) Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Donetsk, near the Russian border, killing all 298 people (civilians) on board. In October 2015, a Dutch-led aviation investigation [concluded](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/world/europe/mh17-malaysia-airlines-dutch-report.html) that the MA flight was shot down by a Russian-made missile. In September 2016, a Dutch-led prosecutorial investigation [concluded](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/malaysia-air-flight-mh17-russia-ukraine-missile.html) that the Russian-made missile was requested by pro-Russian armed groups, transported into Ukrainian territory from Russia, and returned to Russia on the same night that the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down.&nbsp;

In the course of the ongoing conflict, UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported [9,733 killed](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/UAReport16th_EN.pdf) (civilian and military) and [22,720 injured](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/UAReport16th_EN.pdf) (civilian and military) in Ukraine. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported over [1.6 million internally displaced persons](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf) (IDPs) in Ukraine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC Status**

Ukraine is not a State Party of the International Criminal Court (ICC).&nbsp; On April 17, 2014, the government of Ukraine [submitted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr999) a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/997/declarationRecognitionJuristiction09-04-2014.pdf) (dated April 9, 2014) accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC within the period from November 21, 2013 to February 22, 2014. After receiving Ukraine’s declaration, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr999) a preliminary examination. On September 8, 2015, the government of Ukraine [submitted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156) a second [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/other/Ukraine_Art_12-3_declaration_08092015.pdf) (dated September 8, 2015) accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC since February 20, 2014. After receiving Ukraine’s second declaration, the OTP [extended](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156) the temporal scope of the preliminary examination. After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice.&nbsp;

As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Ukraine is in the [subject-matter jurisdiction assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf). The OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that the OTP will continue its analysis “with a view to identifying potential cases within the jurisdiction of the Court.”
