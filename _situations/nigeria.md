**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Nigeria focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an on-going armed conflict which involves Nigerian government forces (Security Forces, Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF)), Boko Haram, and the Islamic Movement in Nigeria. The armed conflict occurred from 2009 to present, but this preliminary examination focuses on the time period of January 2013 to December 2015.&nbsp;

In 1960, Nigeria gained independence from Great Britain, and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa became Prime Minister. In 1966, Prime Minister Balewa was killed in a military coup, and through the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, leaders were deposed and replaced in military coups. In 1999, marking Nigeria’s return to a civilian-led government, Olusegun Obasanjo was elected president. In 2003, President Obasanjo was elected for a second term and his party won a majority of Parliament seats.

In 2002, a Muslim armed group called the Boko Haram was founded with the purpose of imposing Shariah law on northern Nigeria (and has since attempted to expand its control to central Nigeria). In July 2009, Boko Haram [attacked](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/world/africa/28nigeria.html) police stations in northern Nigeria, and Nigerian government forces [counterattacked](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/world/africa/30nigeria.html) Boko Haram compounds. The violent clash led to an estimated [700 deaths](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/world/africa/03nigeria.html), mostly of [suspected](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/world/africa/04nigeria.html) Boko Haram followers including its [founder](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/world/africa/31nigeria.html). After the Nigerian government’s harsh response, Boko Haram [radicalized](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/11/world/africa/boko-haram-nigeria-maps.html) into a violent Salafi-jihadist group which promulgated its vision of Islam through suicide bomb attacks, killings, kidnappings, sexual slavery, forced marriages, and sexual violence against Christians, moderate Muslims, the Nigerian government, and Westerners. In 2010, Boko Haram carried out Christmas day bomb attacks against churches and carried out Christmas day bombings in [2011](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-blast-idUSTRE7BO03020111225), [2012](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-attack-idUSBRE8BO05Y20121225), and [2015](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/12070317/At-least-14-killed-in-Boko-Haram-Christmas-day-gun-attack-in-Nigeria.html). In August 2011, Boko Haram carried [carried out](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/world/africa/27nigeria.html) a suicide IED attack the UN office in Abuja. In February 2014, Boko Haram [burned or shot](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/world/africa/dozens-killed-in-nigeria-school-assault-attributed-to-islamist-militant-group.html) to death at least 29 teenage boys at a Buni Yadi state college in Yobe state. In April 2014, Boko Haram [kidnapped](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/world/africa/nigerians-hold-second-day-of-protests-over-mass-abductions.html) over 200 girls from a Chibok school in Borno state.&nbsp;

In December 2015, claiming a security threat, Nigerian government forces attacked the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, a Shiite group, killing an estimated [830](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/world/africa/shiite-muslim-sect-alleges-massacre-by-nigerias-military.html) Shiites in Zaria. After [international calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/africa/us-calls-for-investigation-of-shiite-deaths-in-nigeria.html) for investigation of the Zaria massacre, Nigeria [created](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/world/africa/nigeria-plans-inquiry-into-deadly-clashes-between-army-and-shiite-sect.html) a judicial commission.&nbsp; Nigeria’s judicial commission reported that Nigerian government forces had used excessive force and killed [348](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-violence-idUSKCN10C2GM) Shiites in Zaria.

During the course of the conflict, Amnesty International [reported](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/038/05/PDF/G1503805.pdf?OpenElement) that Boko Haram killed over 4000 civilians in 2014 alone, kidnapped over 100 civilians, inflicted rape, sexual violence, and sexual slavery upon women, and recruited child soldiers. Amnesty International also [reported](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/038/05/PDF/G1503805.pdf?OpenElement) that Nigerian government forces have killed over 1000 suspects in military detention facilities, and subjected suspected civilians to extrajudicial executions, torture, and forced detentions. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported over [2.17 million internally displaced persons](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf) (IDPs) in Nigeria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC Status**

Nigeria is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/nigeria.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on September 27, 2001. On November 18, 2010, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in Nigeria, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [announced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP_Weekly_Briefing_64-ENG.pdf) a preliminary examination. After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice. In an August 2013 report, the OTP [determined](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/docs/SAS%20-%20NGA%20-%20Public%20version%20Article%205%20Report%20-%2005%20August%202013.PDF) that there is a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed by Boko Haram since July 2009. In a November 2015 report, the OTP [identified](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) eight potential cases involving crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by Boko Haram (six cases) and Nigerian government forces (two cases).

As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Nigeria is in the [admissibility assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-pe_eng.pdf). The OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-pe_eng.pdf) that the OTP will continue “its analysis of any new allegations of crimes committed in the situation of Nigeria and its assessment of admissibility of the eight potential cases identified, in addition to any possible new potential case, in order to reach a decision on whether the criteria for opening an investigation are met.”&nbsp;
