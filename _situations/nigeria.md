Since 2009, there has been a steady flow of violence between a militant Islamic group called Boko Haram and Nigerian security forces. In 2014, hostilities intensified between the two parties after Boko Haram initiated a violent campaign. Alleged atrocities occurred after Presidential and National Assembly elections on March 28, 2015 and State elections that took place on April 11, 2015. Following a heavy amount of violence in Northern Nigeria, leaving an estimated 800 people dead, Nigerian police allegedly committed mass arrests of suspected Boko Haram supporters in the Northern provinces in an attempt to restore order, followed by alleged torture and execution. Boko Haramâ€™s violence includes allegations of targeting and killing of teachers, education workers and students; forceful conscription of child soldiers; and abductions of women and children. At least around 600 teachers have been killed and 19,000 have been forced to flee. The Nigerian army is also alleged to have also been involved with sectarian clashes, killing almost 347 Shiite Muslims in Northern Nigeria.

Nigeria ratified the Rome Statute on September 27, 2001. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the opening of a preliminary examination on November 18, 2010. The preliminary examination is currently in phase 3, the admissibility assessment stage.
