Following the 2011 National Assembly and Presidential elections, violence broke out in northern Nigeria, leaving an estimated 800 people dead. Police arrested hundreds of people in the northern provinces in an attempt to restore order. The Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, condemned the violence and called for a restoration of peace.

Since 2009, Nigeria has also seen violent acts from the militant group known as Boko Haram. Violence between Boko Haram and Nigerian security forces has only increased since the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) began its observation of Nigeria.

On November 18, 2010, OTP announced publicly that a Preliminary Examination in Nigeria was already underway. During the Preliminary Examination, the Prosecutor has issued numerous public statements urging the Nigerian people to refrain from electoral violence. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Admissibility Assessment stage.
