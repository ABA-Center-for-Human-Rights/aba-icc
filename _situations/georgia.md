After 12 years with no significant military engagements, the skirmishes between South Ossetian forces and the Georgian Army deteriorated into armed conflict on August 7, 2008. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) received allegations that South Ossetian forces pillaged houses and property, displacing 30,000 ethnic Georgians.

On 14 August 2008, OTP publicly announced that a Preliminary Examination was already underway. From June 22-24 2010, a delegation of OTP conducted site visits in Georgia and concluded that there was no impunity for crimes committed in Georgia. OTP made a second site visit in February 2011 and received information from both the Russian and Georgian governments outlining what happened in the region. On October 13, 2015, the Prosecutor submitted a [request](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Art_15_Application_Summary-ENG.pdf) to Pre-Trial Chamber I for authorization to initiate an investigation into the situation in Georgia pursuant to article 15(3) of the Statute. On January 27, 2015, Pre-Trial Chamber I [authorized](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2195945.pdf) the Prosecutor to open a formal investigation in Georgia as requested.
