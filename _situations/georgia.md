The [skirmishes](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/http:/www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/) between pro-Russian South Ossetian forces and the Georgian government deteriorated into an armed conflict between Georgia, Russia, and South Ossentian forces on August 7, 2008. During this conflict, the South Ossetian [forces](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia) allegedly pillaged houses and property, displacing 30,000 ethnic Georgians. There are also allegations of illegal killings, forced displacements and persecution of ethnic Georgian civilians, and attacks on peacekeepers by both South Ossetian and Georgian forces. This 2008 conflict took place amongst simmering tensions due to national debates over Georgia’s relationship with Russia and Europe.

Georgia [ratified](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1072) the Rome Statute on September 5, 2003. On August 14, 2008, the International Criminal Court (ICC)’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) publicly announced that a [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) in Georgia was already underway. On January 27, 2016, Pre-Trial Chamber I [authorized](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2195945.pdf) the Prosecutor’s request to open a formal investigation in Georgia. There are currently no cases within this situation.
