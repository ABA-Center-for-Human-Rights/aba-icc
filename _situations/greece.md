The Preliminary Examination in Comoros focuses on alleged atrocity crimes (crimes against humanity, war crimes) committed during an attack upon civilians which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and ships registered to various countries including Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia and which occurred on May 31, 2010.

On January 3, 2009, as a part of the continuing conflict between Israel and Palestine, Israel enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip to restrict the movement of people and goods in and out of the region. In response to Israel’s blockade, the Free Gaza Movement decided to send an eight-boat flotilla of ships called the “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” to break the blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. On May 28, 2010, the eight-boat flotilla of ships embarked upon the journey from Turkey; however, one ship was unable to depart and one ship was delayed due to mechanical issues. The eight ships carried over 700 passengers from 36 countries, and the ships were registered to various countries including State Parties Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia. &nbsp;&nbsp;

On May 31, 2010, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) surrounded and [boarded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israeli-attacks-gaza-flotilla-activists) the six ships that had remained on schedule, and the interception resulted in the deaths of ten civilians (nine Turkish citizens and one dual Turkish-American citizen), injuries to numerous humanitarian aid workers, and the detention of numerous humanitarian aid workers. On June 1, 2010, the UN Security Council [called](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/un-condemns-israel-assault-gaza-flotilla) for an investigation into the IDF attack on the flotilla. &nbsp;

In particular, the deaths of Turkish citizens due to the IDF raid on the Mavi Marmara, a ship registered to Comoros, [soured](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/gaza-flotilla-raid-turkey-prime-minister-israel) the diplomatic relationship between Turkey and Israel for many years. In 2010, Israel [refused](http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/12/26/turkey.israel.relations/index.html) to apologize to Turkey for the deaths of Turkish citizens, but, in 2016, Turkey and Israel [signed](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/middleeast/israel-turkey-relations/) a deal under which Israel would provide a $20 million compensation fund for Turkish families and Turkey would end all legal claims against the Israeli government and Israel military members. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Greece [ratified](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/western%20european%20and%20other%20states/Pages/greece.aspx) the Rome Statute on May 15, 2002. On May 14, 2013, Comoros referred itself to the ICC, and the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a preliminary examination into the State Parties involved–Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia. On November 6, 2014, the OTP closed the preliminary examination on grounds that the Rome Statute's requirements for opening a formal investigation had not been met.
