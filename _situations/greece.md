**Background**

The Situation in the registered vessels of Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during a violent interception of the ships which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and civilians on the ships.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC status &nbsp;**

Greece is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/western%20european%20and%20other%20states/Pages/greece.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on May 15, 2002.&nbsp; In May 2013, after receiving a [referral](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf) from the Government of Comoros of alleged atrocity crimes committed on its territory, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-14-05-2013) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; In November 2014, the OTP[ closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-06-11-2014) the preliminary examination and decided not to open a formal investigation on the basis that the admissibility requirement had not been met (the cases would not be of sufficient gravity). &nbsp;In July 2015, at Comoros’ request for review of the OTP’s decision, Pre-Trial Chamber I [held](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_13139.PDF) that the OTP made errors in coming to the conclusion that the admissibility requirement had not been met and requested that the OTP reconsider its decision.&nbsp; In November 2015, at the OTP’s appeal of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision, the Appeals Chamber [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_20965.PDF) to dismiss the OTP’s appeal on the basis of inadmissibility without considering the merits.&nbsp;

As of November 2016, the OTP&nbsp;[reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that it had conducted a *de novo* review and is preparing to issue its final decision in the near future.
