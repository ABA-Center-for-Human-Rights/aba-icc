**Background**

The Situation in the Central African Republic II (CAR II) focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an armed conflict which involved CAR government forces under President Francois Bozize, Seleka rebel armed group, and anti-balaka rebel armed group. The armed conflict occurred from August 1, 2012 to present. &nbsp;

From 2005 to 2012, amidst growing public discontent with President Bozize’s policies, [armed groups](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20141124_CAR.pdf) formed to overthrow the CAR government. In August 2012, Seleka was formed from Muslim [armed groups](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20141124_CAR.pdf), under Seleka leader Michel Djotodia, to overthrow President Bozize. On December 10, 2012, Seleka [launched](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-car-rebels-idUKBRE8BR0EC20121228) a rebellion. By late December, Seleka had taken over the northern and central regions of the CAR and [advanced](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-car-rebels-idUKBRE8BR0EC20121228) towards Bangui. On January 2, 2013, Seleka [agreed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-car-rebels-idUSBRE9010K520130102) to enter peace talks. On January 11, 2013, President Bozize and Seleka [signed](http://www.reuters.com/article/car-rebels-idUSL5E9CBAKF20130111) the Libreville agreement which established a ceasefire and a political transition process.

On March 23, 2013, Seleka [attacked](http://www.reuters.com/article/centralafrica-rebels-idUSL5N0CF0LR20130323) Bangui; President Bozize [fled](http://www.reuters.com/article/centralafrica-rebels-idUSL5N0CG07Y20130325) the country. On April 13, 2013, Seleka leader Djotodia [was declared](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrican-president-idUSBRE93C0CG20130413) interim president. On September 13, 2013, under international pressure to control Seleka violence, President Djotodia [announced](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrican-rebels-idUSBRE98C0W020130913) the dissolution of Seleka. However, Seleka continued to attack Christian civilians and suspected anti-balaka supporters, pillage towns, and target men, women, and children for rape, sexual violence, and mutilations. In response to Seleka’s campaign of violence, Christian armed groups formed the anti-balaka (“anti-machete”) and began their own campaign of violence against Muslim civilians and suspected Seleka supporters. In January 2014, President Djotodia [resigned](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrican-idUSBREA090OC20140110) and Catherine Samba-Panza [was declared](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrican-idUSBREA0J0VT20140120) interim president. Despite several peace attempts (ex.&nbsp;[July 2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-talks-idUSKBN0FS1MZ20140723) and [May 2015](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-politics-idUSKBN0NV0U020150510), [February 2019](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032091)), CAR is [considered&nbsp;](https://www.unocha.org/car)at [high risk](https://www.globalr2p.org/countries/central-african-republic/) of ongoing atrocities.

In 2015, CAR established (through Organic Law 15/003 ([English summary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl-nat.nsf/implementingLaws.xsp?documentId=92C4EC76991F04C4C1257ECB004E25D5&amp;action=openDocument&amp;xp_countrySelected=CF&amp;xp_topicSelected=GVAL-992BU6&amp;from=state){: target="_blank"})) a hybrid tribunal, the&nbsp;[Special Criminal Court (SCC)](https://www.icjafrica.com/single-post/2018/10/23/about-the-new-special-criminal-court-in-the-central-african-republic){: target="_blank"}, integrated into the CAR national justice system but applying a mix of CAR and international law. The SCC “is authorized to investigate, prosecute and try serious violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law . . . in particular the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes” from January 1, 2003 onward. It began active work in 2018 following the adoption of Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

&nbsp;

**ICC Status**

The CAR is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/central%20african%20republic.aspx) to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on October 3, 2001. On February 7, 2014, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in the CAR, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-07-02-2014) a preliminary investigation. On May 30, 2014, the CAR [referred](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/2014-05-30-CAR-referral.pdf) itself to the ICC. In a September 2014 report, the OTP [determined](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Art_53_1_Report_CAR_II_24Sep14.pdf) that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the Seleka committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp; In the same report, the OTP [determined](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Art_53_1_Report_CAR_II_24Sep14.pdf) that there is a reasonable basis to believe that anti-balaka committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. On September 24, 2014, the OTP [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1043) a formal investigation. Within the Situation in CAR II, &nbsp;there are two cases: *The Prosecutor v. Yekatom & Ngaïssona* and *The Prosecutor v. Saïd*.
