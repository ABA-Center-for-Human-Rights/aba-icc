The second Situation in the Central African Republic (Central African Republic (CAR) II) focuses on atrocities committed in late 2012 and again in early 2013 during fighting between Séléka (Muslims) and anti-Balaka (mainly Christian militia). [Muslim Séléka rebels seized power](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-rebels-idUSBRE92M0AU20130324) and territory in a military campaign characterized by widespread killing of civilians, burning and looting of homes, and other atrocities. This campaign resulted in the occupation of CAR's capital, Bengui, [forcing President Bozizé into exile](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/24/central-african-republic-president-flees) in 2013 (read CAR I). In response, anti-Balaka forces organized an offensive against the Séléka. During this offensive, anti-Balaka began [committing](http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/12/christians-muslims-clash-in-central-african-republic/100652/) large-scale reprisal attacks against Muslim civilians and others, including rape, murder, forced displacement, persecution and pillaging.

CAR ratified the Rome Statute on October 3, 2001. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1043) of a preliminary examination on 7 February 2014 into a new set of alleged atrocities committed in CAR. Subsequently, CAR again [referred](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/2014-05-30-CAR-referral.pdf) itself to the ICC on May 30, 2014. Following a preliminary examination, the OTP officially [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1043) its second formal investigation in CAR on September 24, 2014. Within the CAR II Situation, there are no ongoing cases.
