The second situation in the Central African Republic (called Central African Republic II). In late 2012 and again in early 2013, mostly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power and territory in a military campaign characterized by widespread killing of civilians, burning and looting of homes, and other serious crimes. This campaign resulted in their taking of Bangui, the CAR's capital, and forcing President Boziz√© into exile. In response, groups calling themselves the anti-Balaka - a mainly Christian militia - organized to fight against the Seleka. The anti-Balaka began committing large-scale reprisal attacks against Muslim civilians and others.

As the CAR is a State Party to the ICC, the Prosecutor was empowered to open a preliminary examination of this new set of alleged crimes in February 2014. Subsequently, the CAR then [referred](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/2014-05-30-CAR-referral.pdf) the situation to the ICC on May 30, 2014. Following the conclusion of its preliminary examination, the Prosecutor officially [opened](http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/pages/pr1043.aspx) an investigation on September 24, 2014. Within the CAR, there are two separate ongoing situations (Central African Republic I being the other one).
