The Situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) (II) focuses on alleged atrocity crimes (crimes against humanity, war crimes) committed during an armed conflict which involved CAR government forces under President Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, Seleka (Muslim) rebel forces under Michel Djotodia, and anti-balaka (Christian) armed groups and which occurred in the CAR between August 1, 2012 to present. &nbsp;

From 2005 to 2012, due to the CAR government’s lack of governance, President Boziz&eacute;’s corruption and cronyism, and resultant poor economic conditions, various armed rebel groups (*Union des Forces D&eacute;mocratiques pour le Rassemblement* (UFDR), *Armee Populaire pour la Restauration de la Democratie* (APRD), *Front democratique du Peuple Centrafricain* (FDPC)) launched attacks with the aim of overthrowing the CAR government headed by President Boziz&eacute;. Further complicating the conflict, foreign armed groups (the Lord’s Resistance Army, the Janjaweed) moved into the CAR to use the CAR as a base to launch attacks against Uganda, Chad, and Sudan. Even with international military assistance, the CAR government was unable to maintain control of CAR territory, defend itself from domestic armed groups, and prevent foreign armed groups from entering the CAR.&nbsp;

In August 2012, a coalition called Seleka was formed from armed groups (UFDR, *Convention des patriotes pour la justice et la paix* (CPJP), *Convention Patriotique du salut du Kodro* (CPSK)), whose members are predominantly Muslim and hail from the northeast of the CAR, to overthrow the President Boziz&eacute;-led CAR government. In December 2012, Seleka [launched a rebellion](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/central-african-republic) against the CAR government and quickly took over northern and central regions of the CAR, but Seleka was [stopped](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/world/africa/central-africa-on-the-brink-rebels-halt-their-advance.html)&nbsp;short of taking the capital Bangui by a defending coalition of forces from the CAR, Chad, and the Economic Community of Central African States’ (ECCAS). In January 2013, the parties [signed](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/world/africa/rebels-agree-to-cease-fire-in-central-african-republic.html) the Libreville Agreement which established a ceasefire and process for a political transition under President Boziz&eacute;. In March 2013, Seleka [took control of Bangui](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/africa/rebels-seize-capital-of-central-african-republic.html) and [declared Mr. Djotodia](https://www.brookings.edu/2013/04/06/what-future-for-the-central-african-republic/) as President of the CAR. In the wake of its rise to power, Seleka continued its [campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/central-african-republic-verge-of-genocide) of murder, rape, beatings, mutilations, and pillaging and [targeted](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/10502752/Seleka-the-militia-terrorising-Central-African-Republics-Christian-population.html) civilians that were non-Muslim or suspected of supporting President Boziz&eacute;. In September 2013, under international pressure to control Seleka violence, President Djotodia announced the dissolution of Seleka, but Seleka continued its campaign of violence. In response to the extreme violence of Seleka, Christian armed groups called “anti-balaka” (“anti-machete”) began their own campaign of violence and targeted civilians that were Muslim or suspected of supporting the Seleka regime.

In January 2014, President Djotodia was pressured into resigning and [Catherine Samba-Panza](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/world/africa/un-body-set-to-appoint-a-monitor-for-central-african-republic.html) was appointed Interim President of the CAR. In February 2016, [Faustin Archange Touadera](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/world/africa/newly-elected-central-african-republic-leader-faces-hard-realities.html) was elected President of the CAR.

The CAR ratified the Rome Statute on October 3, 2001. On February 7, 2014, after issuing several statements warning that violence in the CAR fell under ICC jurisdiction, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a [preliminary investigation](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-07-02-2014). On May 30, 2014, the CAR [referred](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/2014-05-30-CAR-referral.pdf) itself to the ICC. On September 24, 2014, the OTP [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1043) a [formal investigation](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Art_53_1_Report_CAR_II_24Sep14.pdf) into atrocity crimes committed in the CAR. Within the Situation in CAR II, there are no cases.
