President Hugo Chavez was elected to the presidency in July 2000. His presidency saw increased polarization among citizens as his power grew, resulting in his vast control of the Venezuelan government. On April 11, 2002, between 400,000 and 600,000 people [participated](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18348.htm) in a march in Caracas outside the Miraflores Palace, the presidential palace, to demand the resignation of President Chavez. The march devolved into [violence](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1929498.stm) between Chavez opposition and government forces, resulting in more than 13 dead and more than 100 injured. President Chavez was taken into custody, and opposition business leader, Pedro Carmona proclaimed himself president. Just 48 hours later, on April 14, Chavez was returned to power.

Venezuela ratified the Rome Statute on June 7, 2000. Following a preliminary examination, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) concluded that many of the allegations concerned events outside of the temporal jurisdiction of the ICC, which begins July 1, 2002. The OTP further concluded that the acts committed by both the Venezuelan government and groups opposed to the government that did fall into the temporal jurisdiction following the attempted coup were not a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population. Based on these conclusions, the OTP decided to [close](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Venezuela_9_February_2006_03.pdf) the preliminary examination in Venezuela on February 9, 2006.
