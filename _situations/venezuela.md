Violence erupted in Venezuela in early 2014 as a result of post-election protests. Security forces in Caracas are alleged to have made use of "free-fire" zones to disperse protesters. An estimated 45 people were killed as a result of violence in the country.

The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) received 34 communications concerning the situation in Venezuela. On February 9, 2006, the OTP closed its Preliminary Examination in Venezuela.
