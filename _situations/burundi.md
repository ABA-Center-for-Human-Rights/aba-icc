**Background** &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Situation in Burundi focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an ongoing political crisis which involved Burundi government forces, armed pro-government groups (CNDD-FDD-ruling political party, Imbonerakure-youth wing of the CNDD-FDD), and protest groups (opposition political parties and citizens). In April 2015, President Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would run for a third presidential term which sparked protests in the months leading up to and after the presidential election. Protesters argued that Nkurunziza was barred from running for a third term under the Constitution which states the president may only serve two terms. Nkurunziza supporters argued that his first term was by parliamentary vote not by electoral vote, so he had only served one term by election and was thus eligible to run for another term by election. In May 2015, with reports of judicial intimidation and judges fleeing the country due to death threats, the Constitutional Court held that President Nkurunziza could run for a third term. In May 2015, a failed military coup also occurred. On July 21, 2015, the presidential election was held. On July 25, 2015, Burundi’s Electoral Commission declared President Nkurunziza the winner of the presidential election; the results were criticized by international observers as well as by Burundi citizens. During the course of the political crisis, from April 2015 to 2016, civilians (protesters, those suspected to be protest-sympathizers, as well as journalists) have been killed and injured by Burundi government forces with retaliatory attacks and killings by protest groups. There are also reports of torture, rape and sexual violence, imprisonment, and enforced disappearances committed by Burundi government forces. Over 230,000 Burundians have fled the country to escape the violent government response to protests.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC Status** &nbsp;&nbsp;

From 2004 to 2016, Burundi was a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/burundi.aspx) to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on September 21, 2004. In October 2016, Burundi’s Parliament [voted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1244) to withdraw from the ICC and [notified](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/highlight/2016-10-27.html) the UN Secretary General of the withdrawal. Withdrawal from the ICC becomes effective one year after withdrawal notification to the UN Secretary General, unless otherwise specified, under Article 127(1) of the Rome Statute, and a State is not discharged, by reason of its withdrawal, from its obligations under the Rome Statute including the duty to cooperate with investigations and proceedings which were commenced prior to the date on which the withdrawal became effective under Article 127(2) of the Rome Statute. In April 2016, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in Burundi, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-stat-25-04-2016) a preliminary examination. After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice. As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Burundi is in the [jurisdiction assessment (subject matter) phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
