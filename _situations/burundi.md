Following national elections in July 2015, growing violence in Burundi led to mass human rights violations and a breakdown in the rule of law. This crisis began after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his third run for office in alleged violation of the country’s constitution. This announcement trigged a failed coup attempt in May 2015 that led to the [death](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35436560) of at least 439 people and the displacement of 250,000 people to neighboring countries. This level of violence mimics the country’s 1993-2006 civil war that left over 300,000 people dead.

Fighting resumed in [December 2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35083823) with military attacks against three military camps, security forces and the [*Imbonerakure*](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/07/07/416827738/above-the-law-a-militia-threatens-to-push-burundi-to-the-brink) (“those who see far” in Kirundi), a rebel group of disarmed fighters, resulting in "extremely disturbing patterns" of [human rights violations](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/burundi-deploy-experts-monitor-violence-151217142631031.html) and violence between the [Hutus and Tutsi](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/world/africa/burundi-crackdown-puts-hutus-and-tutsis-and-the-west-on-edge.html). The United Nations Security Council and African Union tried to mediate the situation but were unsuccessful, resulting in the President’s rejection of their [international peacekeeping efforts](http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12315.doc.htm). Since the onset of violence and fighting in April 2015, there have been allegations of [atrocities](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/25/burundi-abductions-killings-spread-fear) including unlawful killings, false imprisonment, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as cases of enforced disappearances. In addition, the *Imbonerakure* have no legal right to arrest, yet have been [stopping](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/06/burundi-spate-arbitrary-arrests-torture) people arbitrarily, beating, and handing them over to the intelligence services, allegedly resulting in cases of torture.

Burundi ratified the Rome Statute on September 21, 2004. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-stat-25-04-2016) of a preliminary examination on April 25, 2016. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/burundi) is currently in phase 2, the subject-matter jurisdiction stage.
