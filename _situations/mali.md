The Situation in Mali involves a conflict between government forces of the Republic of Mali and the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (*Mouvement national de lib&eacute;ration de l'Azawad*, MNLA) a northern separatist group fighting for increased autonomy. The MNLA took control of several cities in northern Mali but was overtake by extremist Islamist groups including the al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa*(Mouvement pour l'unicit&eacute; et le jihad en Afrique de l'Ouest*, MUJAO).

The insurgency began in January 2012, and peaked with the seizure of much of northern Mali by armed groups in April 2012. On March 22, 2012, President Tour&eacute; was [forcefully ousted](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/world/africa/mali-president-amadou-toumani-toure-resigns-after-coup.html) shortly before scheduled Presidential elections. Various groups attempted to gain exclusive control of northern Mali, and in doing so, allegedly executed detainees and inflicted [severe punishments, including torture](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/25/mali-security-forces-disappear-20-torture-others). The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [estimates](http://www.unhcr.org/50a35d509.html) that as of November 1, 2012, 412,000 people had been displaced into surrounding countries. As armed groups took control of northern Mali, instances of looting and rape were reported as well, including allegedly [destroying religious buildings](http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/12/world/africa/mali-shrines-destroyed/) and other cultural [institutions](http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/18/world/africa/mali-shrines/) in Timbuktu and other areas.

Mali ratified the Rome Statute on August 16, 2000. Mali [referred](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICCReferralLetterMali130712_02.pdf) itself to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on July 13, 2012. Following a preliminary examination, the Office of the Prosecutor officially [opened](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICC-OTP-20130116-PR869_01.pdf) an investigation on January 13, 2013. Within the Situation in the Republic of Mali, there is one case: [*The Prosecutor v.* *Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-al-faqi-al-mahdi/).
