The situation in the Republic of Mali involves a conflict between government forces of the Republic of Mali and several armed groups fighting for independence or increased autonomy, including the Mouvement national de lib&eacute;ration de l'Azawad (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, MNLA), al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine and the Mouvement pour l'unicit&eacute; et le jihad en Afrique de l'Ouest (Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, MUJAO) and other militias.

The insurgency began in January 2012, and peaked with the seizure of much of northern Mali by rebel groups in April 2012. On March 22, 2012, President Tour&eacute; was forcefully ousted shortly before scheduled Presidential elections. After April, these various groups also fought among themselves, attempting to gain exclusive control of northern Mali. In carrying out their insurgency, various groups allegedly executed detainees and inflicted severe punishments, including torture. As armed groups took control of northern Mali, instances of looting and rape were reported, and groups allegedly destroyed religious buildings and institutions in Timbuktu and other areas. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that as of November 1, 2012, 412,000 people had allegedly been displaced, half of which were refugees in surrounding countries.

Within the situation in the Republic of Mali, there is one case.
