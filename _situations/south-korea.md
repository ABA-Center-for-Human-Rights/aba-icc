At the end of World War II, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two separate States, North and South Korea. Since 1945, the two States have been in and out of open armed conflict with minor skirmishes in between. North Korea is believed to have been responsible for deaths of South Korean civilians and marines on Yeonpyeong Island on November 23, 2010 and the sinking of a South Korea warship, the Cheonan.

On December 6, 2010, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [announced](http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/40BB19F9-3193-4A76-9E70-EB8BE39363B3/282744/KoreaEng1.pdf) publicly that a Preliminary Examination in South Korea was already underway. On June 23, 2014, OTP concluded that the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, on March 26, 2010, the Cheonan, was an attack on a lawful military target. OTP further concluded the deaths on Yeonpyeong Island were not the result of attacks intentionally directed against civilians. Based on those conclusions, OTP decided to close the Preliminary Examination in South Korea and published its findings on the preliminary examination of the Situation in a [report](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/SAS-KOR-Article-5-Public-Report-ENG-05Jun2014.pdf).
