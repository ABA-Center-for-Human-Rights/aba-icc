In March 2003, a coalition led by the United States of America (US) invaded and occupied Iraq, including the capitol city of Baghdad. On April 7, 2003, allied United Kingdom ([UK) forces contingent took control of Basra](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6977914.stm). On May 7, the US declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq, and the formal occupation of Iraq ended on June 30, 2004 when the new [interim government](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/28/iraq.iraq1) of Iraq assumed control and consented to the presence of coalition forces. During the deployment from 2003 through 2008, UK military service personnel are accused of systematically [abusing hundreds of detainees](https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/17/dispatches-uk-still-needs-account-abuses-iraq) in different UK-controlled facilities across Iraq, including denial of fair trials and sexual violence. A total of 1268 cases of ill-treatment and [unlawful killings](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27397695) are alleged.&nbsp;

Iraq is not a State Party to the Rome Statute and has not lodged a declaration under article 12(3) accepting the jurisdiction of the Court. In accordance with article 12(2)(b) of the Statute, acts on the territory of a non-State Party will fall within the jurisdiction of the Court only when the person accused of the crime is a national of State Party to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The UK ratified the Rome Statute on October 4, 2001. The ICC therefore has jurisdiction over alleged atrocity crimes committed on UK territory or by UK nationals anywhere.

On February 9, 2006, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) [announced](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006_07.pdf) it would not seek to open an investigation into the alleged crimes committed by UK forces in Iraq. As a result of new evidence received, the OTP announced the [reopening](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/OTP20140513_01.pdf) of the preliminary examination on May 13, 2014. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) is currently in phase 2, the subject-matter jurisdiction stage.
