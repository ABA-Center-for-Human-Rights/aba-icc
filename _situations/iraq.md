In March 2003, a U.S.-led coalition occupied portions of Iraq, including the capitol city of Baghdad. On April 7, 2003, a U.K. contingent took control of Basra, and, by May 7, the U.S. declared an end to major combat operations. On May 8, 2003, the U.S. and U.K. provided the U.N. Security Council with specific legal authorities that justified the occupation. The occupation ended on June 30, 2004 when the new interim government of Iraq assumed control of occupying forces and consented to the presence of coalition forces.

The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) received 240 communications under Article 15 of the Rome Statute requesting the opening of a Preliminary Examination. Communication alleges that UK Services personnel systematically abused hundreds of detainees in different UK-controlled facilities across the territory of Iraq over the whole period of their deployment from 2003 through 2008. The communications further submit that over two hundred cases of alleged unlawful killing in custody and in situations outside of custody in Iraq can be attributed to UK Services personnel. A total of 1268 cases of alleged ill-treatment and unlawful killings are documented in the 10 January 2014 and 29 September 2015 communications. Crimes allegedly occurred in military detention facilities and other locations under the control of UK Services personnel in southern Iraq, including in temporary detention/processing facilities and in longer-term detention and internment facilities.

Iraq is not a State Party to the Rome Statute and has not lodged a declaration under article 12(3) accepting the jurisdiction of the Court. In accordance with article 12(2)(b) of the Statute, acts on the territory of a non-State Party will fall within the jurisdiction of the Court only when the person accused of the crime is a national of a State that has accepted jurisdiction. The UK deposited its instrument of ratification to the Rome Statute on October 4, 2001. The ICC therefore has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed on UK territory or by UK nationals as of July 1, 2002.

On February 9, 2006, OTP announced it would not seek to open an investigation into the situation in Iraq. On January 10, 2014, OTP received a communication from the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights requesting the Preliminary Examination be reopened. On May 13, 2014, OTP announced that the Preliminary Examination in Iraq would be [reopened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/otp-statement-iraq-13-05-2014.aspx), citing new information received in January. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Assessment stage.
