The Situation in the Republic of Kenya involves [mass violence](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/world/africa/31kenya.html?mtrref=www.google.com) and accompanying atrocities that occurred after the country's contested 2007-2008 election. The violence spread across six of the eight Kenyan provinces: Nairobi, North Rift Valley, Central Rift Valley, South Rift Valley, Nyanza Province and Western Province. Following the announcement of the re-election of President [Mwai Kibaki](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/world/africa/31kenya.html?_r=0), supporters of the opposition candidate, Raila Odinga, rejected the declared election results and accused the government and the President of [electoral fraud](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kibaki-stole-kenyan-election-through-vote-rigging-and-fraud-772349.html). A series of protests and demonstrations devolved into post-election violence, mainly perpetrated between two tribes: that of Kibaki, the Kikuyu, and that of Odinga, the Luo. The violence [resulted](https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/03/16/ballots-bullets/organized-political-violence-and-kenyas-crisis-governance) in over 1,100 deaths, over 3,500 injuries, [900 acts](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/15/kenya-unending-toll-rape-survivors) of [documented rape](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/briefing-papers/briefing-survivors-sexual-attacks-kenya-seek-justice-post-election-violence) and [sexual violence](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/02/15/i-just-sit-and-wait-die/reparations-survivors-kenyas-2007-2008-post-election), and up to 500,000 forcibly displaced persons.

Kenya ratified the Rome Statute on March 15, 2005. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) [initiated](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/doc785972_06.pdf) a *proprio motu* investigation on November 26, 2009, which was later [authorized](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/court%20records/chambers/pretrial%20chamber%20ii/Pages/19.aspx) by the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber II on March 31, 2010. Within the Situation in Kenya, there are the following cases: [*Prosecutor v. Paul Gicheru and Philip Kipkoech Bett*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-paul-gicheru-and-philip-kipkoech-bett/), [*The Prosecutor v.
