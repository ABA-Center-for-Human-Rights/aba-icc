The situation in the Republic of Kenya involves mass violence that occurred after the country's contested 2007-2008 election. Supporters of the opposition candidate rejected the declared election results and accused the government of electoral fraud. A series of protests, demonstrations and post-election violence unfolded largely along tribal lines. More than 1,100 people died, 3,500 were injured and up to 600,000 forcibly displaced over the course of the violence.

After receiving a report on the crimes from a Kenyan-created commission, the Office of the Prosecutor opened a _proprio motu_ investigation on November 26, 2009, which was later [authorized](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/court%20records/chambers/pretrial%20chamber%20ii/Pages/19.aspx) by the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber II on March 31, 2010. Within the Kenya situation, there are four ongoing cases.
