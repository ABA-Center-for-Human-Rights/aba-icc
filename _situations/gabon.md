**Background**

The Situation in Gabon focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an ongoing political crisis which involved Gabonese government forces and protest groups (opposition political parties and citizens). President Ali Bongo announced he would run for a second term against opposition candidate, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Chairman of the African Union, Jean Ping. On August 27, 2016, the presidential election was held. Though the presidential election results were scheduled to be announced on August 30, the results were delayed and announced on August 31. The National Electoral Commission declared President Ali Bongo the winner of the presidential election. However, the EU Electoral Observation Mission in Gabon noted “evident anomalies.” According to the National Electoral Commission, there was a national electoral turnout of 59.5%, and President Bongo won 49.8% of the vote and Jean Pin won 48.2% of the vote. According to the National Electoral Commission, President Bongo’s home province Haut-Ogoou&eacute; was the last province to be counted, and his home province reported a provincial electoral turnout of 99.93% with President Bongo winning 95.46% of the vote. Protesters demonstrated and rioted throughout cities across the country.&nbsp; There are reports that protesters set fire to Gabonese National Parliament building and that Gabonese government forces bombed the opposition’s headquarters. In the course of the conflict, civilians were killed and injured by Gabonese government forces.

**ICC Status**

Gabon is a State Party to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on September 20, 2000. In September 2016, after receiving a referral from the Government of Gabon of alleged atrocity crimes committed in its territory, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a preliminary examination. After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice. As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Gabon is in the jurisdiction assessment (subject matter) phase. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
