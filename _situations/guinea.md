**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Guinea focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during a political crisis which involved Guinean government forces (*Conseil National pour la D&eacute;mocratie et le D&eacute;veloppement* (“CNDD”) under President Moussa Dadis Camara), and protest groups (opposition political parties and citizens). The political crisis occurred from December 2008 to January 2010, but this preliminary examination focuses on the “September 28 Massacre” which occurred on September 28, 2009.&nbsp;

In 1958, Guinea gained independence from France, and Ahmed Sekou Toure became president but ruled the country as a dictator. In 1984, after President Toure’s death, Lansana Conte seized power in a military coup and proclaimed himself president. In 1993, in Guinea’s first multiparty democratic elections, Lansana Conte was elected as president and his party won the majority of National Assembly seats. Despite criticism from opposition parties and the public, President Conte was elected president for a second term in 1998 and a third term in 2003. In late December 2008, the day after President Conte’s death and before the end of his term, junior military officers [seized](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/world/africa/24guinea.html) power in a military coup, and Captain Moussa Dadis Camara [was declared](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/world/africa/25guinea.html) president.&nbsp;

On September 28, 2009, Guinea’s independence day, 50,000 protesters [gathered](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/africa/29guinea.html) in a national stadium to express discontent with President Camara’s plans to run for president and the military junta’s rule over the country. Guinea government forces [began shooting](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/africa/29guinea.html) into the crowds; an estimated [157](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/africa/30guinea.html) were killed. In addition to stabbings and other violence against protesters, women [were targeted](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/africa/30guinea.html) for rape and sexual violence. Guinea government forces quickly [removed](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/africa/22guinea.html) bodies from the stadium, making it difficult to ascertain the true number of those killed. After an [assassination attempt](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/guinea/6722535/Guineas-president-wounded-in-assassination-attempt.html), President Camara left the country for medical treatment. On June 27, 2010, Guinea [held](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/world/africa/28guinea.html) the first round of presidential elections and, on November 7, 2010, [held](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/world/africa/08guinea.html) the second round of presidential elections.&nbsp; Alpha Conde was elected president of Guinea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The [UN International Commission of Inquiry](http://www.un.org/press/en/2009/sgsm12581.doc.htm) on the events of September 28, 2009 in Guinea reported that the Commission had identified [156 persons](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2009/693) who were killed (or their bodies were never found), at least [109 women](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2009/693) subjected to rape and sexual violence, and over [100 victims](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2009/693) subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, as well as forced detentions. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC Status**

Guinea is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/guinea.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on July 14, 2003.&nbsp; On October 14, 2009, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in Guinea, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [announced](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICC_-_ICC_Prosecutor_confirms_situation_in_Guinea_under_examination_02.pdf) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice.&nbsp; In a December 2011 report, the OTP [determined](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/63682F4E-49C8-445D-8C13-F310A4F3AEC2/284116/OTPReportonPreliminaryExaminations13December2011.pdf) that there is a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity were committed by Guinea government forces.

As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Guinea is in the [admissibility assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-pe_eng.pdf).&nbsp; The OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-pe_eng.pdf) that “the adoption of additional key investigative steps during the reporting period and the Minister of Justice’s stated determination to set the stage for a trial in 2017 are encouraging signs.”&nbsp; The OTP will continue to assess the national government’s investigation and “encourage Guinean authorities to hold to their commitment to complete this phase of proceedings within the best possible deadline.”
