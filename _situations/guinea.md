Following the [death](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/23/lansana-conte-profile) of President Lansana Conté on December 22, 2008, the National Council for Democracy and Development (*Conseil national pour la démocratie et le développement*, CNDD), a military junta, seized power on December 23, 2008, in the [Guinean *coup d’état*](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/world/africa/26guinea.html). On September 28, 2009, the security forces of the CNDD allegedly used [e](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/08/31/guinea-respect-rights-opposition)xcessive force, including accusations of rape, mutilation, and murder, to quell an Independence Day demonstration in Conakry by groups in opposition to the military junta. The United Nations (UN) created a Commission of Inquiry (“UN Commission”) in October 2009 to investigate allegations of [human rights abuses](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/12/17/guinea-stadium-massacre-rape-likely-crimes-against-humanity), including the [Independence Day](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/27/guinea-september-28-massacre-was-premeditated) violence. The UN Commission [concluded](http://www.refworld.org/docid/4b4f49ea2.html) that during this incident 150 Guineans were killed and 100 women were raped.

Guinea ratified the Rome Statute on July 14, 2003. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICC_-_ICC_Prosecutor_confirms_situation_in_Guinea_under_examination_02.pdf) of a preliminary examination on October 14, 2009. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) is currently in phase 3, the admissibility assessment stage.
