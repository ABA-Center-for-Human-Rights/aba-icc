Following the death of President Lansana Conté in December 2008, the Conseil national pour la démocratie et le développement (The National Council for Democracy and Development, CNDD), a military junta, seized power in Guinea. On September 28, 2009, the CNDD allegedly used violence (including accusations of rape, mutilation, and murder) to quell an Independence Day demonstration by groups in opposition to the military junta. The U.N. created a Commission of Inquiry in October 2009 to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, including the Independence Day violence.

On October 14, 2009, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) announced publicly that a Preliminary Examination in Guinea was already underway. Since 2009, the OTP has continued to collect information on alleged crimes. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Admissibility Assessment stage.
