Following the death of President Lansana Cont&eacute; in December 2008, the Conseil national pour la d&eacute;mocratie et le d&eacute;veloppement (The National Council for Democracy and Development, CNDD), a military junta, seized power in Papua New Guinea(PNG). On September 28, 2009, the CNDD allegedly used violence (including accusations of rape, mutilation, and murder) to quell an Independence Day demonstration by groups in opposition to the military junta. The UN created a Commission of Inquiry in October 2009 to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, including the Independence Day violence.

On July 14, 2003 Guinea Ratified the Rome Statute which allowed the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to announce publicly on October 14, 2009 that a Preliminary Examination was already underway. Since 2009, the OTP has continued to collect information on alleged crimes. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Admissibility Assessment stage.
