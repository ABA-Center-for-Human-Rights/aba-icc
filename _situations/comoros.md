**Background**

The Situation in the registered vessels of Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during a violent interception of the ships which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and civilians on the ships.&nbsp; &nbsp;

As a part of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, the Israeli government enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, and the Free Gaza Movement periodically sent flotillas to break the blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp; On May 28, 2010, a flotilla of ships embarked upon the journey to Gaza from Turkey.&nbsp; The flotilla carried over 700 passengers from 36 countries.&nbsp; On May 31, 2010, the IDF boarded the ships to enforce Israel’s blockade, and the interception resulted in the deaths of ten civilians (nine Turkish citizens and one dual Turkish-American citizen) and injuries to many humanitarian aid workers.&nbsp; On June 1, 2010, the UN Security Council [called](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/un-condemns-israel-assault-gaza-flotilla) for an investigation into the IDF attack on the flotilla.&nbsp; &nbsp;

**ICC status &nbsp;**

Comoros is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/comoros.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on August 18, 2006.&nbsp; In May 2013, after receiving a [referral](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf) from the Government of Comoros of alleged atrocity crimes committed on its territory, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-14-05-2013) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice.&nbsp; In November 2014, the OTP[ closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-06-11-2014) the preliminary examination and decided not to open a formal investigation on the basis that the admissibility requirement had not been met (the cases would not be of sufficient gravity).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

In July 2015, at Comoros’ request for review of the OTP’s decision, Pre-Trial Chamber I [held](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_13139.PDF) that the OTP made errors in failing to consider that its list of possible perpetrators could include those who bear the most responsibility for the crimes and made errors in assessing the scale, the nature, the manner of commission, and the impact of the crimes.&nbsp; Pre-Trial Chamber I concluded that the OTP had incorrectly determined that the admissibility requirement had not been met (that the cases would not be of sufficient gravity) and requested that the OTP reconsider its decision.&nbsp;

In November 2015, at the OTP’s appeal of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision, the Appeals Chamber [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_20965.PDF) that, as the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision was not on jurisdiction or admissibility of a case, the OTP could not file an appeal against the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision and dismissed the OTP's appeal on the basis of inadmissibility without considering the merits. &nbsp;Further, the Appeals Chamber held that though the Pre-Trial Chamber may request reconsideration of the OTP’s decision, the Pre-Trial Chamber may not compel the OTP to reconsider its decision.&nbsp; As of November 2016, the OTP has [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that it has conducted a de novo review and is preparing to issue its final decision in the near future.
