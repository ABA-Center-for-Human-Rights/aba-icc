**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in the registered vessels of Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during a violent interception of the ships which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and civilian passengers on the ships. The Israel-Palestine conflict has occurred since the 1950s to the present, but this preliminary examination focuses on the IDF attack which occurred on May 31, 2010.&nbsp;

In 1948, with the official end of Great Britain’s colonial mandate and the declaration of Israel’s independence as a state, the League of Arab States declared it would protect the rights of Palestinians and attacked Israel. Israel defense forces repelled the Arab forces and maintained control over Israel’s territory. In 1967, in the Six-Day War, Israel again defeated the Arab forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria and then gained control of the Sinai Peninsula (later returned to Egypt), the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Israel’s control of these territories has long been disputed by its neighbors and has led to a decades-long conflict with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In 2005, Israel withdrew its military forces from Gaza but maintained control over Gaza through the enforcement of a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and a border barrier. The Free Gaza Movement periodically sent flotillas to break the blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;

On May 28, 2010, a flotilla of ships embarked upon the journey to Gaza from Turkey. The flotilla carried over 700 passengers, mainly pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid workers, from 36 countries. On May 31, 2010, the IDF [boarded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israel-kills-activists-flotilla-gaza) the ships to enforce Israel’s blockade, and the IDF [fired upon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israeli-attacks-gaza-flotilla-activists) civilian passengers which resulted in the deaths of ten civilians (nine Turkish citizens and one dual Turkish-American citizen) and injuries to many humanitarian aid workers. On June 1, 2010, the UN Security Council [called](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/un-condemns-israel-assault-gaza-flotilla) for an investigation into the IDF attack on the flotilla.&nbsp; &nbsp;

**ICC status &nbsp;**

Comoros is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/african%20states/Pages/comoros.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on August 18, 2006. In May 2013, after receiving a [referral](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf) from the Government of Comoros of alleged atrocity crimes committed on its territory, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-14-05-2013) a preliminary examination. After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice. &nbsp;On November 6, 2014, the OTP[ closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-06-11-2014) the preliminary examination and decided not to open a formal investigation on the basis that the admissibility requirement had not been met (the cases would not be of sufficient gravity).

On July 16, 2015, at Comoros’ request for review of the OTP’s decision, Pre-Trial Chamber I [held](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_13139.PDF) that the OTP had made errors in its assessment that the admissibility requirement had not been met (that the cases would not be of sufficient gravity) and requested that the OTP reconsider its decision. On November 6, 2015, at the OTP’s appeal of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision, the Appeals Chamber [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_20965.PDF) to dismiss the OTP's appeal on the basis of inadmissibility without considering the merits. Further, the Appeals Chamber held that though the Pre-Trial Chamber may request reconsideration of the OTP’s decision, the Pre-Trial Chamber may not compel the OTP to reconsider its decision.&nbsp;

As of November 2016, the OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that it had conducted a *de novo* review and is preparing to issue its final decision in the near future.
