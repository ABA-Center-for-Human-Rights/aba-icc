On June 12, 2014, members of the Hamas terrorist group kidnapped 3 Israeli children from the West Bank. Their bodies were found by the Israeli Defense Force on June 30, 2014, leading Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to issue a statement vowing revenge against Hamas. Following escalating tension from the kidnappings, the southern region of Israel was hit by missiles fired by Hamas members in the Gaza Strip. The rocket fire killed seven Israeli civilians. The Israeli Air Force responded with air strikes in Gaza designed to cripple Hamas' missile capabilities. An estimated 2,100 Palestinian civilians were killed in the air strikes.

The Palestinian Authority made an Article 12(3) declaration on December 31, 2014 accepting ICC jurisdiction dating back to June 13, 2014. On January 2, 2015, Palestine acceded to the Rome Statute. On January 16, 2015, the Office of the Prosecutor announced publicly that a Preliminary Examination in Palestine was already underway. Palestine became a State Party to the Rome Statute on April 1, 2015. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Initial Assessment stage.
