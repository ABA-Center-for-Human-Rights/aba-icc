**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Palestine focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, also known as Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups (Hamas’ Internal Security Forces and Al-Qassam Brigades).&nbsp; The 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict occurred between July 7, 2014 and August 26, 2014.&nbsp;

In 1948, with the declaration of Israel’s independence as a state, the League of Arab States (forces from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia) declared it would intervene to protect Palestinians and launched an attack against Israel.&nbsp; Israeli defense forces repelled the combined Arab forces and maintained control over Israel’s territory.&nbsp;

In 1967, with Egypt mobilizing forces along the Egyptian-Israeli border and blockading the Tiran Straits, Israel launched the Six-Day War by preemptively attacking Egypt and defeated Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.&nbsp; Israel gained control of the Sinai Peninsula (later returned to Egypt), the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.&nbsp;

In 2005, after decades of violence, ceasefires, and negotiations over the territories and other issues, Israel withdrew its military forces and settlers from Gaza but has maintained control of the territory through a border barrier as well as a naval blockade.&nbsp; Anger over Israel’s harsh control of Gaza and the West Bank, among other issues, has fueled Palestinian protests and attacks against Israel.&nbsp; In 2008, due to Palestinian rockets fired over the border barrier, Israel invaded Gaza and attacked (Hamas) military targets.&nbsp; In 2012, again due to Palestinian rockets fired over the border barrier, Israel invaded Gaza and attacked (Hamas) military targets.

In 2014, due to a kidnapping and [murder of three Israeli teenagers](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/middleeast/Israel-missing-teenagers.html) in the West Bank by Palestinian extremists and a retaliatory kidnapping and [murder of a Palestinian teenager](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/israel.html) in East Jerusalem by Israeli extremists, tensions were heightened between Hamas-governed Gaza and Israel.&nbsp; Israel launched an [air strike campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/world/middleeast/israel-steps-up-offensive-against-hamas-in-gaza.html) and a [ground invasion](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip.html) against Gaza.&nbsp; Palestinian armed groups were alleged to have launched attacks from or near residential areas, hospitals, and schools.&nbsp; The IDF was alleged to have launched air strikes against such residential areas, hospitals, and schools (including [six UNRWA schools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/-sp-gaza-israeli-strikes-unrwa-schools)) in Gaza.&nbsp; In the course of the conflict, the [UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx) reported that over 2,100 Palestinians, including [1,462 civilians](http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16119&amp;LangID=E), were killed and over 65 Israelis, including [6 civilians](http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16119&amp;LangID=E), were killed.&nbsp; The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported over [290,000 internally displaced persons](http://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/2014_gaza_conflict_and_unrwa_shelter_response.pdf) (IDPs) in UNRWA shelters and an estimated total of 490,000 IDPs.&nbsp; &nbsp;

**ICC Status**

Palestine is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/asian%20states/Pages/Palestine.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on January 2, 2015.&nbsp; Previously, in January 2009, the Palestinian Authority submitted a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/74EEE201-0FED-4481-95D4-C8071087102C/279777/20090122PalestinianDeclaration2.pdf) recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICC; however, as Palestine’s status was an “observer entity” at the United Nations (UN), the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-st-14-09-02) that the declaration could not be accepted.&nbsp; In November 2012, when Palestine’s status was changed from “observer entity” to “non-member observer state,” the OTP [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-st-14-09-02) that Palestine could submit a new declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC.&nbsp; On January 1, 2015, the government of Palestine submitted a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/press/Palestine_A_12-3.pdf) (dated December 31, 2014) recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICC since June 13, 2014.&nbsp; On January 16, 2015, after receiving Palestine’s declaration, the OTP [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1083) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice.&nbsp;

As of November 2016, the OTP reported that the preliminary examination of Palestine is in the [(subject-matter) jurisdiction assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) and that the OTP will continue its assessment “in order to establish whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation.” &nbsp;
