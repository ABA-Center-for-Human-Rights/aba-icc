**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Palestine focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, also known as Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups (Hamas’ Internal Security Forces and Al-Qassam Brigades).  The 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict occurred between July 7, 2014 and August 26, 2014.

In 1948, with the declaration of Israel’s independence as a state, the League of Arab States (forces from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia) declared it would intervene to protect Palestinians and launched an attack against Israel.  Israeli defense forces repelled the combined Arab forces and maintained control over Israel’s territory.

In 1967, with Egypt mobilizing forces along the Egyptian-Israeli border and blockading the Tiran Straits, Israel launched the Six-Day War by preemptively attacking Egypt and defeated Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.  Israel gained control of the Sinai Peninsula (later returned to Egypt), the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.

In 2005, after decades of violence, ceasefires, and negotiations over the territories and other issues, Israel withdrew its military forces and settlers from Gaza but has maintained control of the territory through a border barrier as well as a naval blockade.  Anger over Israel’s harsh control of Gaza and the West Bank, among other issues, has fueled Palestinian protests and attacks against Israel.  In 2008, due to Palestinian rockets fired over the border barrier, Israel invaded Gaza and attacked (Hamas) military targets.  In 2012, again due to Palestinian rockets fired over the border barrier, Israel invaded Gaza and attacked (Hamas) military targets.

In 2014, due to a kidnapping and [murder of three Israeli teenagers](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/middleeast/Israel-missing-teenagers.html) in the West Bank by Palestinian extremists and a retaliatory kidnapping and [murder of a Palestinian teenager](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/israel.html) in East Jerusalem by Israeli extremists, tensions were heightened between Hamas-governed Gaza and Israel.  Israel launched an [air strike campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/world/middleeast/israel-steps-up-offensive-against-hamas-in-gaza.html) and a [ground invasion](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip.html) against Gaza.  Palestinian armed groups were alleged to have launched attacks from or near residential areas, hospitals, and schools.  The IDF was alleged to have launched air strikes against such residential areas, hospitals, and schools (including [six UNRWA schools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/-sp-gaza-israeli-strikes-unrwa-schools)) in Gaza.  In the course of the conflict, the [UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx) reported that over 2,100 Palestinians, including [1,462 civilians](http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16119&amp;LangID=E), were killed and over 65 Israelis, including [6 civilians](http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16119&amp;LangID=E), were killed.  The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported over [290,000 internally displaced persons](http://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/2014_gaza_conflict_and_unrwa_shelter_response.pdf) (IDPs) in UNRWA shelters and an estimated total of 490,000 IDPs.

**ICC Status**

Palestine is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/asian%20states/Pages/Palestine.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on January 2, 2015.  Previously, in January 2009, the Palestinian Authority submitted a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/74EEE201-0FED-4481-95D4-C8071087102C/279777/20090122PalestinianDeclaration2.pdf) recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICC; however, as Palestine’s status was an “observer entity” at the United Nations (UN), the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-st-14-09-02) that the declaration could not be accepted.  In November 2012, when Palestine’s status was changed from “observer entity” to “non-member observer state,” the OTP [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-st-14-09-02) that Palestine could submit a new declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC.  On January 1, 2015, the government of Palestine submitted a [declaration](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/press/Palestine_A_12-3.pdf) (dated December 31, 2014) recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICC since June 13, 2014.  On January 16, 2015, after receiving Palestine’s declaration, the OTP [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1083) a preliminary examination.  After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice.

As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Palestine is in the [subject-matter jurisdiction assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf).  The OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that the OTP will continue its assessment “in order to establish whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation.”
