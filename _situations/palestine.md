The [conflict in Gaza](http://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136495202/background-israels-pre-1967-boundaries) between Hamas and Israeli forces dates back to 1967 when Israel allegedly occupied Gaza. Since 1967, there have been numerous armed conflicts of varying intensity and duration in Gaza between Israel security forces and organized groups operating in Gaza. In June 2014, tensions escalated following the kidnapping and murder of [three Israeli teenagers](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28371966), with a Palestinian teenager killed in alleged retribution. June and July 2014 also saw an increase of launched rockets by Palestinian armed groups. The Israeli Air Force responded with air strikes in Gaza designed to cripple Hamas' missile capabilities, followed by a ground operation beginning July 17, 2014. An estimated 2,100 Palestinian [civilians were killed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/9138976/Israeli-air-strikes-on-Gaza-and-Palestinian-rocket-attacks.html) in these air strikes. The Israeli and Palestinian forces reached an unconditional ceasefire on August 26.

The following [crimes](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx) were allegedly [committed in Gaza](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28439404) between July 7 and August 26, 2014: 2000 Palestinians, including 1000 civilians and over 70 Israelis, including six civilians were reportedly killed. Over 12,000 people were injured in these attacks and they were Palestinians and Israelis both. All parties are alleged to have committed war crimes under article 8 of the Rome Statute during the 51 day conflict.

Palestine ratified the Rome Statute on January 2, 2015. On December 31, 2014, Palestine made a [declaration](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/Palestine_A_12-3_03.pdf) accepting ICC jurisdiction from June 13, 2014 onwards with no end date. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1083) of a preliminary examination on January 16, 2015. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) is currently in phase 2, the subject-matter jurisdiction stage.
