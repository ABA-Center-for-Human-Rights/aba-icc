The Preliminary Examination in Columbia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes (crimes against humanity\*, war crimes\*\*) committed during a conflict which involved Colombian government forces, paramilitary groups, and armed rebel groups called the&nbsp;*Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas - Ejericito del pueblo*(FARC-EP) and the *Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional* (ELN) and which occurred from November 2002\* and from November 2009\*\* to the present.

Colombia has experienced 50 years of armed conflict between rebel armed forces, most notably the [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11400950) (FARC-EP) and the [National Liberation Army](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/world/americas/colombias-second-largest-rebel-group-joins-peace-talks-with-government.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=3421D83EAB2188148DEAF8374C0DC86D&amp;gwt=pay) (ELN); paramilitary armed groups; and the national armed forces. In the context of the conflict, civilians, including human rights defenders, public officials, trade unionists, teachers, and members of indigenous and afro-Colombian communities, have been [subjected](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf) to a range of alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes by all groups, including widespread acts of murder, sexual violence, forcible transfer, hostage taking, enforced disappearance, torture, and the use of child soldiers. The violence has [resulted](https://www.hrw.org/americas/colombia) in the forced displacement of more than 6.8 million Colombians and the death of thousands of civilians.

Colombia ratified the Rome Statute on August 5, 2002. Colombia issued a [declaration](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1998/11/19981110 06-38 PM/Related Documents/CN.834.2002-Eng.pdf) with the ratification pursuant to article 124 excluding war crimes from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for a seven-year period. In June 2004, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP)&nbsp;[opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/organs and bodies/otp/Policies and Strategies/OTPReportonPreliminaryExaminations13December2011.pdf)&nbsp;a preliminary examination. The [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) is currently in phase 3, the admissibility assessment stage.
