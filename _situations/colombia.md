The Preliminary Examination in Columbia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes (crimes against humanity\*, war crimes\*\*) committed during a conflict which involved Colombian government forces, paramilitary groups, and armed rebel groups called the&nbsp;*Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas - Ejericito del pueblo*(FARC-EP) and the *Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional* (ELN) and which occurred from November 2002\* and from November 2009\*\* to the present.

Colombia has experienced 50 years of armed conflict between rebel armed forces, most notably the [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11400950) (FARC-EP) and the [National Liberation Army](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/world/americas/colombias-second-largest-rebel-group-joins-peace-talks-with-government.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=3421D83EAB2188148DEAF8374C0DC86D&amp;gwt=pay) (ELN); paramilitary armed groups; and the national armed forces. In the context of the conflict, civilians, including human rights defenders, public officials, trade unionists, teachers, and members of indigenous and afro-Colombian communities, have been [subjected](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf) to a range of alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes by all groups, including widespread acts of murder, sexual violence, forcible transfer, hostage taking, enforced disappearance, torture, and the use of child soldiers. The violence has [resulted](https://www.hrw.org/americas/colombia) in the forced displacement of more than 6.8 million Colombians and the death of thousands of civilians.

Colombia ratified the Rome Statute on August 5, 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction over Rome Statute crimes committed since November 1, 2002, but, under Colombia's declaration pursuant to article 124 of the Rome Statute, the ICC may only exercise jurisdiction over war crimes committed since November 1, 2009. In June 2004, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP)&nbsp;[opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf)&nbsp;a preliminary examination. As of November 2015, the preliminary examination is under phase 3 (admissibility assessment), and the OTP is [monitoring](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) national proceedings to investigate and prosecute atrocity crimes.
