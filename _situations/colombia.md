Colombia has experienced 50 years of armed conflict between rebel armed forces, most notably the [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11400950) (*Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas - Ejericito del pueblo*, FARC-EP) and the [National Liberation Army](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/world/americas/colombias-second-largest-rebel-group-joins-peace-talks-with-government.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=3421D83EAB2188148DEAF8374C0DC86D&amp;gwt=pay) (*Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional*, ELN); paramilitary armed groups; and the national armed forces. In the context of the conflict, civilians, including human rights defenders, public officials, trade unionists, teachers, and members of indigenous and afro-Colombian communities have been [subjected](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf) to a range of alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes by all groups, including widespread acts of murder, sexual violence, forcible transfer, hostage taking, enforced disappearance, torture, and the use of child soldiers. The violence has [resulted](https://www.hrw.org/americas/colombia) in the forced displacement of more than 6.8 million Colombians and the death of thousands of civilians.

Colombia ratified the Rome Statute on August 5, 2002. Colombia issued a [declaration](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1998/11/19981110 06-38 PM/Related Documents/CN.834.2002-Eng.pdf) with the ratification pursuant to article 124 excluding war crimes from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for a seven-year period. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int/organs and bodies/otp/Policies and Strategies/OTPReportonPreliminaryExaminations13December2011.pdf) of a preliminary examination in June 2004.
