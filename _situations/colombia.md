**Background**

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Colombia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an armed conflict which involved Colombian government forces (national armed forces, police), paramilitary groups, and guerilla armed groups such as the&nbsp;*Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas - Ejericito del pueblo* (FARC-EP) and the&nbsp;*Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional*&nbsp;(ELN).&nbsp; The conflict occurred from the 1960s to September 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the 1960s, left-wing guerilla armed groups, such as FARC-EP and the ELN, were formed with the purpose of overthrowing the government of Colombia.&nbsp; FARC-EP gained the support of low-income farmers and laborers who felt disenfranchised by the Colombian government and financed its rebel activities through drug-trafficking, high-profile kidnapping ransoms, and extortion.&nbsp; In the 1980s, right-wing paramilitary groups were formed by high-income landowners, farmers, and ranchers who also felt neglected by the Colombian government and sought to combat the FARC-EP’s violence and territorial encroachments.&nbsp; From 1996 to 2002, despite peace attempts in 1982 and 1998, the violence sharply escalated as Colombian government forces, paramilitary groups, and FARC-EP guerilla armed groups sought to gain control through killings, kidnappings, sexual violence, torture, forced disappearances, and recruitment of child soldiers.&nbsp; &nbsp;

On September 26, 2016, President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC-EP leader Rodrigo Londo&ntilde;o [signed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-agreement.html) a peace agreement which outlined the transition process in which FARC-EP would surrender its assets and arms in exchange for political representation and amnesties or reduced sentences for crimes.&nbsp; On October 2, 2016, in a referendum, Colombian voters [voted against](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/world/colombia-peace-deal-defeat.html) the peace agreement.&nbsp; On November 24, 2016, President Santos and FARC-EP leader Rodrigo Londo&ntilde;o [signed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/world/americas/colombia-juan-manuel-santos-peace-deal-farc.html) a revised peace agreement.&nbsp; On November 30, 2016, the Colombia Congress unanimously [passed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/world/americas/colombia-farc-accord-juan-manuel-santos.html) the revised peace agreement.&nbsp; On January 18, 2017, the Colombian government [announced](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-rebels-idUSKBN1522NW) that the government and ELN would start formal peace talks on February 8.&nbsp;

In the course of the conflict, Colombia’s National Centre of Historical Memory reported over [220,000 killed](http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/informes2016/basta-ya-ingles/BASTA-YA-ingles.pdf) (from 1958 to 2012), [81.5%](http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/informes2016/basta-ya-ingles/BASTA-YA-ingles.pdf) of which were civilians; [1,754 sexual assault victims](http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/informes2016/basta-ya-ingles/BASTA-YA-ingles.pdf); over [25,000 missing persons](http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/informes2016/basta-ya-ingles/BASTA-YA-ingles.pdf); and over [27,000 kidnappings](http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/informes2016/basta-ya-ingles/BASTA-YA-ingles.pdf).&nbsp; The UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) reported a potential [5000 “false positive” deaths](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/.../A_HRC_28_3_Add_3_FRE.doc) (from 2002 to 2010).&nbsp; Colombian government forces allegedly killed thousands of civilians, falsely claiming they were FARC and ELN guerillas killed in combat, to show successful or positive results (“[false positives](https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/24/their-watch/evidence-senior-army-officers-responsibility-false-positive-killings)”) of the Colombian government’s policy to defeat FARC and ELN.&nbsp; The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported over [6.9 million internally displaced persons](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf) (IDPs) in Colombia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**ICC Status**

Colombia is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/latin%20american%20and%20caribbean%20states/Pages/colombia.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on August 5, 2002.&nbsp; Colombia recognizes the ICC’s jurisdiction over Rome Statute crimes since November 1, 2002, but, under a declaration pursuant to Article 124 of the Rome Statute, recognizes ICC jurisdiction over war crimes committed since November 1, 2009 only.

In June 2004, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in Colombia, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; After opening a preliminary examination, to make a determination to open a formal investigation, the OTP assesses the following factors: jurisdiction (temporal, territorial or personal, and subject matter); admissibility (complementarity and gravity); and the interests of justice. &nbsp;In a November 2012 report, the OTP [determined](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/3D3055BD-16E2-4C83-BA85-35BCFD2A7922/285102/OTPCOLOMBIAPublicInterimReportNovember2012.pdf) that there was a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity were committed by Colombian government forces, FARC-EP, ELN, and paramilitary groups since November 1, 2002 and that war crimes had been committed by Colombian government forces, FARC-EP, and ELN since November 1, 2009.

As of November 2016, the preliminary examination of Colombia is in the [admissibility assessment phase](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf).&nbsp; The OTP [reported](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/161114-otp-rep-PE_ENG.pdf) that the OTP will continue to engage with the government of Colombia on “any concrete and progressive investigative steps and prosecutorial activities undertaken with respect to the potential cases it has identified” and will continue to examine “developments relating to the peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and the FARC-ELP as well as the ELN.”
