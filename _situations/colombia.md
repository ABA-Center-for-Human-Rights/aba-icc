Colombia experienced 50 years of armed conflict between government forces and armed groups, the most notable of which are the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas, "FARC") and the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, "ELN"). The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) received allegations of connection between paramilitaries and some public servants in waging war against the illegal armed groups.

In 2006, OTP publicly announced that a preliminary examination was underway. Colombia ratified the Rome Statute on August 5, 2002; however, Colombia invoked the Article 124 transitional provision which allowed a seven year grace period during which the Court would not prosecute for alleged war crimes. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Admissibility Assessment stage.
