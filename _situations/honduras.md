Honduras elected José Manuel Zelaya Rosales to the presidency in 2005. The relationship between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government deteriorated during his presidency, culminating in a _coup d'etat_ in 2009. On June 28, of that year, President Rosales was stripped of power and forcibly removed from the country. The newly named President, Roberto Michelett, implemented curfews and issued executive decrees restricting civil liberties. Since the 2009 _coup_, violence has increased in Honduras, attributed to police violence against civilians and the rise of drug trafficking.

On November 18, 2009, the Office of Prosecutor (OTP) announced the opening of a Preliminary Examination in Honduras in order to assess if a reasonable basis exists to open an investigation with respect to alleged crimes committed following the _coup d'état_ of June 28, 2009. In November 2013 it was [concluded](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Documents/OTP%20Preliminary%20Examinations/OTP%20-%20Report%20%20Preliminary%20Examination%20Activities%202013.PDF) that human rights violations, committed between June 28, 2009 and January 27, 2010<span class="redactor-invisible-space">, do not constitute crimes against humanity within the meaning of the Statute. Thus they did not fall within the scope of the crimes the International Criminal Court has the mandate to investigate.</span> However, the OTP continued to investigate if crimes committed after January 27, 2010 and in the Bajo Aguán region could impact the previous conclusion or whether they could independently constitute crimes against humanity.

Since the OTP has no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation after carefully weighing the information available against the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, it decided to close the preliminary examination of the situation in Honduras and published a detailed [report](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/SAS-HON-Article_5_Report-Oct2015-ENG.PDF) presenting and explaining the findings on October 28, 2015.
