[Honduras](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/honduras.html) elected [Jos&eacute; Manuel Zelaya Rosales](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-zelaya-factbox-idUSTRE60Q16S20100127) to the presidency in 2005. The relationship between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government deteriorated during his presidency, culminating in a *[coup d'&eacute;tat](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/30/an-old-fashioned-coup)* in 2009. On June 28, 2009, President Zelaya was stripped of power and forcibly removed from the country. The newly named President, Roberto Michelett, [implemented curfews](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123513.stm) and issued executive decrees restricting civil liberties. Since the 2009 *coup*, violence has [increased](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/146758628/who-rules-in-honduras-a-coups-lasting-impact) in Honduras, particularly due to police [violence against civilians](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/20/after-coup/ongoing-violence-intimidation-and-impunity-honduras) and the rise of drug trafficking. Within this region, 100 members of *campesino* (peasant or farmers) movements, members of their families and other individuals associated with their movements were killed from January 2010 to September 2013.

Honduras ratified the Rome Statute on July 1, 2002. On November 18, 2010, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP)&nbsp; [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP_Weekly_Briefing_64-ENG.pdf)&nbsp;a [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf). However, on October 28, 2015, after conducting the preliminary investigation, the OTP&nbsp;[closed](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/QA-HondurasEng_01.pdf) the preliminary examination in Honduras on the grounds that the evidence at the time was not sufficient to support charges of a widespread, systematic attack or of a "course of conduct" against civilians.
