[Honduras](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/honduras.html) elected [Jos&eacute; Manuel Zelaya Rosales](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-zelaya-factbox-idUSTRE60Q16S20100127) to the presidency in 2005. The relationship between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government deteriorated during his presidency, culminating in a [coup d'etat](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/30/an-old-fashioned-coup) in 2009. On June 28, 2009, President Zelaya was stripped of power and forcibly removed from the country. The newly named President, Roberto Michelett, [implemented curfews](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123513.stm) and issued executive decrees restricting civil liberties. Since the 2009 coup, violence has [increased](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/146758628/who-rules-in-honduras-a-coups-lasting-impact) in Honduras, particularly due to police [violence against civilians](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/20/after-coup/ongoing-violence-intimidation-and-impunity-honduras) and the rise of drug trafficking. Within this region, 100 members of campesino (peasant or farmers) movements, members of their families and other individuals associated with their movements were killed from January 2010 to September 2013.

Honduras ratified the Rome Statute on July 1, 2002. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the [opening](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP_Weekly_Briefing_64-ENG.pdf) of a [preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf) on November 18, 2010. The OTP concluded that the acts committed by the de facto regime following the 2009 coup d’&eacute;tat were not a widespread or systematic attack. The OTP further concluded that there was insufficient information to link alleged attacks against civilians together in order to establish a “course of conduct.” Based on those conclusions, the OTP decided to [close](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/QA-HondurasEng_01.pdf) the preliminary examination in Honduras on October 28, 2015.
