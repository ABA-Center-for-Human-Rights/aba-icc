**Background**

The Preliminary Examination in Honduras focused on alleged crimes against humanity committed during a conflict which involved Honduran government forces under interim President Roberto Micheletti (June 2009-January 2010) and elected President Porfirio Lobo Sosa (January 2010-January 2014) and political opposition groups and which occurred from June 2009 to 2014.

[Honduras](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/honduras.html){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;elected&nbsp;[José Manuel Zelaya Rosales](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-zelaya-factbox-idUSTRE60Q16S20100127){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;to the presidency in 2005. The relationship between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government deteriorated during his presidency, culminating in a&nbsp;[*coup d’état*](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/30/an-old-fashioned-coup){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in 2009. On June 28, 2009, President Zelaya was stripped of power and forcibly removed from the country. The newly named President, Roberto Micheletti,&nbsp;[implemented curfews](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8123513.stm){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and issued executive decrees restricting civil liberties. Since the 2009&nbsp;*coup*, violence has&nbsp;[increased](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/146758628/who-rules-in-honduras-a-coups-lasting-impact){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in Honduras, particularly due to police&nbsp;[violence against civilians](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/20/after-coup/ongoing-violence-intimidation-and-impunity-honduras){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and the rise of drug trafficking. Within this region, 100 members of&nbsp;*campesino*&nbsp;(peasant or farmers) movements, members of their families and other individuals associated with their movements were killed from January 2010 to September 2013.

**ICC Status**

Honduras&nbsp;[ratified](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/latin%20american%20and%20caribbean%20states/Pages/honduras.aspx){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;the Rome Statute on July 1, 2002. On November 18, 2010, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP)&nbsp;[opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP_Weekly_Briefing_64-ENG.pdf){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;a&nbsp;[preliminary examination](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-PE-rep-2015-Eng.pdf){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;into allegations of crimes committed between June 2009 and January 2010. In November 2013, the OTP&nbsp;[concluded](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-stat-28-10-2015){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;that, after considering the information available, there was no reasonable basis to open a formal investigation. Later, after receiving new allegations of crimes committed after January 2010, the OTP&nbsp;[continued](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-stat-28-10-2015){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;its preliminary examination. On October 28, 2015, the OTP&nbsp;[closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/SAS-HON-Article_5_Report-Oct2015-ENG.PDF){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;the preliminary examination on grounds that the Rome Statute’s requirements for opening a formal investigation had not been met.
