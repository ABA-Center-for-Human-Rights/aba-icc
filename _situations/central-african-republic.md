The first situation in the Central African Republic (called Central African Republic I) involves an armed conflict between the part of the armed forces of the Central African Republic still loyal to then-President Ange‐Félix Patassé and the Mouvement de libération du Congo (Movement for the Liberation of Congo or MLC - commonly called the "Banyamulengue") and a rebel movement led by François Bozizé (Patassé's former Chief of Staff), who eventually seized control of the government and served as President of the Central African Republic from 2003-2012. Fighting resumed in December 2012, when Séléka, a mainly Muslim rebel group, launched a "major military offensive" to gain territory in CAR. The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) facilitated negotiations for the Libreville Agreements of January 11, 2013, but these agreements ultimately failed to secure lasting peace. By March 2013, Séléka was back on the offensive, taking control of Bangui, CAR's capital, and forcing President Bozizé into exile. Sectarian attacks between Séléka and anti-Balaka, a mainly Christian militia, are on the rise, with anti-Balaka attacking Muslim civilians and Séléka attacking non-Muslims, regardless of their affiliation with either group.

As a State Party, the Central African Republic [referred](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/2005/Pages/otp%20prosecutor%20receives%20referral%20concerning%20central%20african%20republic.aspx) the situation to the ICC on January 7, 2005. Following a preliminary examination, the Prosecutor officially [opened](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/2007/Pages/prosecutor%20opens%20investigation%20in%20the%20central%20african%20republic.aspx) an investigation on May 22, 2007. Within Central African Republic I situation, there are two ongoing cases.
