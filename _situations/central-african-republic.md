**Background**

The Situation in the Central African Republic I (CAR I) focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an armed conflict which involved CAR government forces under President Ange‐Felix Patasse, rebel forces under General Francois Bozize, and the *Mouvement de Libération du Congo* (MLC). The armed conflict occurred from October 26, 2002 to March 15, 2003.

In 1960, the CAR gained independence from France. From the 1960s to the 1990s, CAR leaders ruled as dictators and were replaced in military coups. In 1993, in the CAR’s first multi-party democratic elections, President Patasse was elected. Despite the initial excitement over the CAR’s first peaceful transition of power, factions of the military attempted to overthrow President Patasse in [1996](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1360313.stm) and [1997](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1360313.stm). In October 2001, after another [military coup attempt](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1355986.stm), President Patasse [attempted](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1643356.stm) to arrest the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Bozize, on suspicion of his involvement with the coup. President Patasse-led government forces [clashed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1636193.stm) with General Bozize-led rebel forces.

On October 25, 2002, General Bozize-led rebel forces again [clashed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2361983.stm) with President Patasse-led CAR government forces, which were supported by [Libyan forces](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2368563.stm) and [MLC forces](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2560051.stm). The MLC was a rebel armed group formed by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo to overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Mr. Bemba and President Patasse made an agreement that MLC forces would support CAR forces in exchange for the CAR government not supporting the DRC government. The MLC attacked General Bozize-led rebel forces and civilians, pillaged villages, and targeted men, women, and children for rape and sexual violence. On March 15, 2003, General Bozize-led rebel forces [marched](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2853429.stm) into Bangui and [blocked](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2859407.stm) President Patasse from returning. General Bozize declared himself president. President Bozize was elected in [2005](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4576431.stm) and, after numerous [delays](http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6A80E720101109), re-elected in[2011](http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70S03F20110129).

In 2015, CAR established (through Organic Law 15/003 ([English summary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl-nat.nsf/implementingLaws.xsp?documentId=92C4EC76991F04C4C1257ECB004E25D5&amp;action=openDocument&amp;xp_countrySelected=CF&amp;xp_topicSelected=GVAL-992BU6&amp;from=state))) a hybrid tribunal, the [Special Criminal Court (SCC)](https://www.icjafrica.com/single-post/2018/10/23/about-the-new-special-criminal-court-in-the-central-african-republic), integrated into the CAR national justice system but applying a mix of CAR and international law. The SCC “is authorized to investigate, prosecute and try serious violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law . . . in particular the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes" from January 1, 2003 onward. It began active work in 2018 following the adoption of Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
