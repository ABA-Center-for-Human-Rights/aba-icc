The Situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) (I) focuses on alleged atrocity crimes (crimes against humanity, war crimes) committed during an armed conflict which involved CAR government forces under President Ange‐F&eacute;lix Patass&eacute;, rebel forces under General Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, and the Mouvement de Lib&eacute;ration du Congo (MLC) under Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo and which occurred in the CAR between October 26, 2002 to March 15, 2003.

After throwing off the shackles of French colonialism in 1960, the CAR gained independence but again found itself under the oppressive rule of dictators that ruled by force, embezzled government funds, and exploited natural resources for personal gain and aggrandizement. In the 1990s, the CAR government allowed political parties to form and held presidential elections. In 1993, in the CAR’s first peaceful transition of power, Mr. Patass&eacute; was elected President of the CAR. President Patass&eacute; appointed General Boziz&eacute; as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces but later fired him on suspicion of his involvement with a 2001 coup attempt. Though the CAR seemed to have taken steps towards democracy and rule of law, citizens complained that President Patass&eacute; was another corrupt ruler, in the vein of past dictators under the guise of democracy, and soldiers attempted to overthrow President Patass&eacute; in 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2002.

In October 2002, General Boziz&eacute;-led rebel forces supported by Chad forces fought against President Patass&eacute;-led CAR government forces supported by MLC forces. The MLC was an armed group that was formed to overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The MLC became involved in the CAR conflict when Mr. Bemba and President Patass&eacute; made an agreement that MLC forces would support CAR government forces in exchange for the CAR government not supporting the DRC government. Authorized to enter the CAR from the DRC, the MLC unleashed a campaign of murder, rape, mutilations, and pillaging against civilians who were suspected of supporting the rebellion against the CAR government.

In March 2003, General Boziz&eacute; declared himself President of the CAR and blocked President Patass&eacute; from entering the country.&nbsp; General Boziz&eacute; was elected President of the CAR in 2005 and, again, in 2011.

CAR ratified the Rome Statute on October 3, 2001.&nbsp; On [December 22, 2004](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/doc320182_03.pdf), the CAR [referred](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICCProsecutor_receives_Referral_Concerning_CAR_01.pdf) itself to the ICC.&nbsp; On May 22, 2007, after a preliminary investigation, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a [formal investigation](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=prosecutor%20opens%20investigation%20in%20the%20central%20african%20republic) into atrocity crimes committed in the CAR. Within the Situation in CAR I, there are the following cases: [*The Prosecutor v. Jean Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/) and [*The Prosecutor v. Bemba et al*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba-et-al/).
