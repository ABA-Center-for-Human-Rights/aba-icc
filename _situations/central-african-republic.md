The first Situation in the Central African Republic (Central African Republic (CAR) I) involves an [armed conflict](http://www.cfr.org/global/global-conflict-tracker/p32137#!/conflict/violence-in-the-central-african-republic) between CAR armed forces still loyal to then-[President Ange‐F&eacute;lix Patass&eacute;](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ange-felix-patasse-former-president-of-central-african-republic-dies-at-74/2011/04/06/AF8Em8rC_story.html) and the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (*Mouvement de lib&eacute;ration du Congo*, MLC - commonly called the "*Banyamulengue*"), and a rebel movement led by Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute; (Patass&eacute;'s former Chief of Staff), who eventually seized control of the government and served as President of the CAR from [2003-2012](http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic). Fighting resumed in December 2012, when S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, a mainly Muslim rebel group, launched a major military offensive to gain territory in CAR. The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) facilitated negotiations for the [Libreville Agreements](http://www.un.org/press/en/2013/sc10879.doc.htm) of January 11, 2013, but these agreements ultimately failed to secure lasting peace. By March 2013, a S&eacute;l&eacute;ka offensive forced President Boziz&eacute; into exile. Sectarian attacks between S&eacute;l&eacute;ka (Muslims) and anti-Balaka (mainly Christian militia) escalated with anti-Balaka attacking Muslim civilians and S&eacute;l&eacute;ka attacking non-Muslims, regardless of the affiliation of these non-combatants with either group.

The Central Africa Republic Situation I focuses primarily on alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the conflict that began on July 1, 2002. Alleged crimes committed during this conflict include [rape of hundreds of victims](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/17/central-african-republic-amid-conflict-rape), attacks by multiple perpetrators, [ethnic cleansing](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/report-details-atrocities-in-central-african-republic/), pillaging, and murder.

CAR ratified the Rome Statute on October 3, 2001. CAR [referred](https://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/ICCProsecutor_receives_Referral_Concerning_CAR_01.pdf) itself to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on January 7, 2005. Following a preliminary examination, the Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation on May 22, 2007. Within the CAR I Situation, there are the following cases: *[The Prosecutor v. Jean Pierre Bemba Gombo](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/)* and *[The Prosecutor v. Bemba et al](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba-et-al/)*.
