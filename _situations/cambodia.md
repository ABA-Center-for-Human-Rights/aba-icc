On January 3, 2009, Israel created a naval blockade around the coast surrounding the Gaza Strip as part of an effort to limit the flow of certain goods in and out of the area. The Free Gaza Moment, formed to challenge the blockade, created a flotilla of eight ships registered to Comoros, Greece, Turkey, Kiribati, Togo, Cambodia, and the United States. Of the represented states, only Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia are State Parties to the Rome Statute. On May 31, 2010, members of the Israeli Defense Force intercepted the flotilla and boarded the the _Mavi Marmara_, which flew under the flag of Comoros. While the IDF members were boarding the _Mavi Marmara_, nine people were killed.

On May 14, 2013, Turkey referred Comoros to the ICC, to which the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a Preliminary Examination. The Preliminary Examination extended to the vessels registered to Rome Statute State Parties - Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia. On June 11, 2014, the OTP announced that it was closing the Preliminary Examination, explaining that "Rome Statute legal requirements [had] not been met."
