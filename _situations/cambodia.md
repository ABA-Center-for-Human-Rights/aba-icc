**Background**

The Situation in the registered vessels of Comoros, Greece, and Cambodia focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during a violent interception of the ships which involved Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and civilians on the ships.&nbsp; &nbsp;

**ICC status &nbsp;**

Cambodia is a [State Party](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/states%20parties/asian%20states/Pages/cambodia.aspx) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ratified the Rome Statute on April 11, 2002.&nbsp; In May 2013, after receiving a [referral](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf) from the Government of Comoros of alleged atrocity crimes committed on its territory, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-14-05-2013) a preliminary examination.&nbsp; In November 2014, the OTP[ closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-06-11-2014) the preliminary examination and decided not to open a formal investigation on the basis that the admissibility requirement had not been met (the cases would not be of sufficient gravity). &nbsp;In July 2015, at Comoros’ request for review of the OTP’s decision, Pre-Trial Chamber I [held](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_13139.PDF) that the OTP made errors in failing to consider that its list of possible perpetrators could include those who bear the most responsibility for the crimes and made errors in assessing the scale, the nature, the manner of commission, and the impact of the crimes.&nbsp; Pre-Trial Chamber I requested that the OTP reconsider its decision. &nbsp;In November 2015, at the OTP’s appeal of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision, the Appeals Chamber [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2015_20965.PDF) to dismiss the OTP’s appeal on the basis of inadmissibility without considering the merits and held, furthermore, that though the Pre-Trial Chamber may request reconsideration of the OTP’s decision, the Pre-Trial Chamber may not compel the OTP to reconsider its decision.
