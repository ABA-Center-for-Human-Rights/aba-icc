Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in Washington D.C. and New York City, the United States of America (US) led a coalition in Afghanistan designed to remove the Taliban from power and deny haven to Al Qaeda members responsible for the attacks. While Taliban and Al-Qaeda were disposed, violence persisted across the country, with alleged violations of the laws of war by various groups; use of cluster bombs by the US; and failure to protect millions of refugees and internally displaced. These forces are alleged to routinely use military force when carrying out arrests in Afghanistan, resulting in the unlawful detention of prisoners held in facilities with forty foot walls, razor wires and guard towers. Since 2001, an estimated 92,000 Afghan civilians have been violently killed as a result of the war. Most civilian deaths attributable to insurgents are the result of suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices.

Afghanistan ratified the Rome Statute on February 10, 2003. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the opening of a preliminary examination in January 2007. The preliminary examination is currently in phase 3, the admissibility assessment stage.
