Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., the U.S. led a coalition in Afghanistan designed to remove the Taliban from power and deny haven to Al Qaeda members responsible for the attacks. By mid 2002, the coalition succeeded in creating a new transitional government. However, violence persisted across the country. Between 2007 and 2011, an estimated 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed as a result of the violence. Most civilian deaths attributable to insurgents are the result of suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the Afghan government made numerous transmissions to the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) requesting the opening of a preliminary examination. In 2007, OTP publicly announced that a preliminary examination was underway. Since 2007, OTP has continued to collect information on alleged crimes. The Preliminary Examination is currently in the Admissibility Assessment stage.
