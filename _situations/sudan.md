The situation in the Republic of Sudan involves a conflict between the government of the Republic of Sudan and several armed groups who are fighting for access to and control over resources and land, as well as increased rights for their perceived disadvantaged tribes or social groups. These groups include the Sudan Liberation Army Minni Minawi (SLA-MM), Sudan Liberation Army Abdul Wahid (SLA-AW), Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM-K), several of which later formed a coalition called the United Resistance Front (URF). In the Darfur region, the conflict also has an ethnic dimension. From 2003-05 in conflict in Darfur, pro-government Arab militias (including the Janjaweed, also known as the "Moujahadeen") were accused of conducting an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arabs. In combating rebel forces in Darfur, these pro-government militias allegedly attacked civilian populations, looted civilian property, and forced displacement. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that, since 2005, the Government of the Republic of Sudan has used armed groups to act as its proxies in Darfur, including the Janjaweed. Attacks on aid workers and peacekeepers have also occurred throughout the conflict. Several different parties have been accused of committing human rights violations and attacks on the civilian population, and, while repeated displacement makes accurate numbers difficult to report, tens of thousands of refugees have been displaced by individual attacks. OTP alleges that 460,000 people have been newly displaced in 2013 alone.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan established the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur in October 2004, and, finding reason to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed in Darfur, the Commission recommended the Security Council refer the situation to the ICC in January 2005. The Security Council [referred](http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/85FEBD1A-29F8-4EC4-9566-48EDF55CC587/283244/N0529273.pdf) the situation to the ICC on March 31, 2005 through Resolution 1593. Following a preliminary examination, OTP officially [opened](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/2005/Pages/the%20prosecutor%20of%20the%20icc%20opens%20investigation%20in%20darfur.aspx) an investigation on June 6, 2005. Within the Sudan situation, there are five cases.
