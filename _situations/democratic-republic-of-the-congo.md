The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) involves a protracted armed conflict between the Government of the DRC and many armed groups. The DRC has been the setting for armed conflict since the First Congo War in 1996, which included overflow from conflicts in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda as well as regional alliance between the three countries. Violence erupted again in 1998, when armed rebel groups began to engage with forces of the Government of the DRC (the Second Congo War). During this period, up to 25 armed groups and eight African states were involved in support of one side or the other. The Government of the DRC finalized a peace agreement with rebel groups in 2003 (as well as in Ituri in 2007 and Kivu in 2009), but various groups continued to engage in armed conflict in the eastern parts of the country throughout the past decade. The Office of the Prosecutor's (OTP) investigation initially focused on crimes committed in the Ituri region, where the conflict has been particularly devastating and includes fighting over resources, as well as an ethnic dimension between those of Hema and Lendu ethnicity. The conflict has been characterized by patterns of brutality and attacks against civilians, including rape, torture, forced displacement, the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and mass murder. The OTP estimates that millions of civilians have died over the course of the conflict.

Following a preliminary examination, the OTP officially [opened](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/2004/Pages/the%20office%20of%20the%20prosecutor%20of%20the%20international%20criminal%20court%20opens%20its%20first%20investigation.aspx) an investigation on June 21, 2004. The DRC was the first investigation opened by the ICC. Within the DRC situation, there are six cases.
