The Situation in Uganda involves a protracted conflict between the government of Uganda and armed rebel groups, primarily the [Lord's Resistance Army](http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/about.uganda) (LRA). The LRA has waged an ongoing insurgency against the Ugandan government; the Ugandan Army, the Ugandan Peopleâ€™s Defense Forces (UPDF); and local defense units since 1987. The conflict has [caused](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/24/northern-uganda-displaced-people-out-in-cold) tens of thousands of deaths and abductions, and has displaced up to two million civilians throughout the region, causing many to live in internal displacement persons camps with threats of both LRA and UDPF abuses.

The LRA has consistently targeted and directed attacks against civilians. As part of these attacks, the LRA have used many [tactics](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0905/5.htm) to brutalize the civilian population, including mass murder, mutilation, and forceful abduction of children to be child soldiers, servants, and sex slaves. Although the Lord's Resistance Army has been inactive in northern Uganda since 2006, it still operates in the border region between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. The UDPF has also been [accused](https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/02/04/icc-investigate-all-sides-uganda) of attacks against civilians. Alleged rebel collaborators have been subjected to torture as part of interrogations and have been killed if found outside camps. In the camps, women and girls are victims of sexual abuse and civilians have been killed from beatings. To date, however, the alleged crimes committed by the LRA have been the focus of the conflict.

Uganda ratified the Rome Statute on June 14, 2002. Uganda [referred](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/4BCE015E-9F70-4CD1-8AC2-4CACDB6070B6/277313/ICC_200514100561_English3.pdf)&nbsp;itself to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on December 16, 2003. Following a preliminary examination, the Office of the Prosecutor officially [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=prosecutor%20of%20the%20international%20criminal%20court%20opens%20an%20investigation%20into%20nothern%20uganda) an investigation on July 28, 2004. Within the Situation in Uganda, there are the following cases: [*The Prosecutor v. Joseph Kony and Vincent Otti*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-kony-et-al/) and [*The Prosecutor v. Dominic Ongwen*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-ongwen/).
