[The Presidency](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/presidency/Pages/the%20presidency.aspx) is responsible for the overall administration of the Court, with the exception of the Office of the Prosecutor, and for specific functions assigned to the Presidency in accordance with the Statute.

#### Composition

The Presidency is one of the ICC's four Organs. Its President and First and Second Vice-Presidents are all elected by an absolute majority of the Judges of the Court for a three year renewable term and serve full time.

#### Responsibility

The Presidency is responsible for judicial/legal functions, administration, and external relations of the Court. The Presidency constitutes Chambers (assigning certain judges to each) and assigns cases, conducts judicial review of certain decisions of the Registrar and concludes Court-wide cooperation agreements with States. The Presidency ensures proper administration of the Court (except the Office of the Prosecutor which is responsible for its own administration) and oversees the work of the Registry. The Presidency also maintains relations with States and other entities and promotes public awareness and understanding of the Court through external relations.
