[The Assembly of State Parties](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/Pages/asp_home.aspx) (ASP) is the management, oversight, and legislative body of the Court, and its role is described in Article 112 of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/RS-Eng.pdf). Each State Party has one vote in the ASP. Both the ASP and its Bureau attempt to make decisions by consensus, and when consensus cannot be reached make decisions by two-thirds majority (on matters of substance) and simple majority (on procedure). In addition, the&nbsp;<span class="redactor-invisible-space">President of the Court, the Prosecutor and the Registrar or their representatives may participate in meetings of both the ASP and the Bureau when appropriate.</span>

**Composition**

<span class="redactor-invisible-space">The ASP is made up of representatives of the various states that have ratified and acceded to the Rome Statute (States Parties). States that have signed the Rome Statute may also send observer delegations to the ASP.&nbsp;</span>

<span class="redactor-invisible-space">The ASP has a Bureau that supports its work. The Bureau includes a President, two Vice-Presidents and 18 elected (for three-year terms) members, and according to Rome Statute Art. 112 should "have a representative character, taking into account, in particular, equitable geographical distribution and the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world."&nbsp;</span>

The ASP also provides oversight to the Presidency, Registrar, and Prosecutor and has the ability to establish subsidiary bodies, such as independent oversight mechanisms.</span></span>
