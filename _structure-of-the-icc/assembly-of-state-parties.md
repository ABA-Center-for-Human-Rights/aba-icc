[The Assembly of State Parties](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/Pages/asp_home.aspx) (ASP) is the management, oversight, and legislative body of the Court.

**Composition**

<span class="redactor-invisible-space">The ASP is composed of representatives of the States that have ratified and acceded to the Rome Statute. In addition, the ASP has a Bureau that consists of a President, two Vice-Presidents and 18 members elected by the Assembly for three-year terms that supports the work of the ASP. It is not an organ of the Court but rather its oversight body.</span>
