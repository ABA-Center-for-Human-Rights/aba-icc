[The Office of the Prosecutor](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor.aspx) (OTP) is responsible for receiving referrals and any substantiated information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. OTP examines these referrals and information, conducts investigations, and conducts prosecutions before the Court.

#### Composition

OTP is composed of three Divisions. The Prosecutor, [Fatou Bensouda](http://icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx), makes the final decisions on the commencement of investigations and prosecutions. The Deputy Prosecutor, [James Stewart](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/DeputyProsecutor.aspx), is in charge of all the Divisions; [Phakiso Mochochoko](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/jcod.aspx) is the Head of the Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division; [Fabricio Guariglia](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/director-prosecution.aspx) is the Head of the Prosecutions Division; and [Michel de Smedt](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/acting%20head%20investigations.aspx) is the Head of the Investigations Division.

#### Responsibility

First, OTP performs preliminary analysis on the referrals and information on crimes that it receives to determine if they meet the jurisdictional requirements to merit an investigation. If OTP determines that the situation meets jurisdictional requirements, then it conducts an investigation into the situation. Should the investigation yield enough evidence to merit the issuing of arrest warrants, OTP applies to the Pre-Trial Chamber for the issuance of a warrant or a summons to appear. After the accused has been arrested or summoned to court voluntarily, OTP presents its charges and its evidence to the Pre-Trial Chamber and the Pre-Trial Chamber determines whether to confirm the charges. After charges are confirmed, OTP conducts the entirety of the prosecution at trial.
