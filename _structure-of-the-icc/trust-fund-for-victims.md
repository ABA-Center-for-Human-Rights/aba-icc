[The Trust Fund](https://www.trustfundforvictims.org/)'s (TFV) dual mandate serves victims of crimes that fall within the Court's jurisdiction through the provision of 1) general assistance including physical rehabilitation, psychological rehabilitation, and/or material support and 2) implementation of reparations awards ordered by the Court against a convicted person.

#### Composition

The TFV is guided by a Board of Directors, the five members of which are elected by the Assembly of Parties for three-year terms. Members of the Board of Directors serve pro bono and come from different world regions.

The TFV uses fines and forfeitures of persons convicted through ICC proceedings, as well as through voluntary donations from states and individual donors. The TFV works with national and international partners to implement its programs through a grant-making process.

#### Responsibility

The two mandates of the TFV, general assistance and reparations, were established to provide support to victims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. While reparations are linked to accountability, arising from individual criminal responsibility of a convicted person, the assistance mandate is not and can address broader implications of the crimes and conflict at issue.

Through its assistance mandate, the TFV provides assistance to victims and their families independently from the conviction of a particular person, or before a conviction happens. This allows for assistance to reach victims and affected communities more quickly, and reaches victims of crimes committed in the conflict at issue without the requirement that they be directly tied to charges and the case against a particular defendant.

The TFV fulfills its reparations mandate by creating plans and programs to implement reparations orders decided by the Court. Although reparations can be direct and aimed at individuals, including individual compensation or material support and physical or psychological rehabilitation. They can also be collective or symbolic, which might address broader societal or collective harm caused by atrocity crimes. These possibilities allow for the Court to be responsive to the context of specific cases and the wishes of victims, and for reparations measures to encourage restoration, reconciliation and address community-wide needs.

Since 2008, the Trust Fund has [implemented projects](https://www.trustfundforvictims.org/en/what-we-do/assistance-programmes) in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and the Central African Republic, and is launching an assistance program in C&ocirc;te dâ€™Ivoire. The Trust Fund is also working to implement reparations orders in [several cases](https://www.trustfundforvictims.org/en/what-we-do/reparation-orders).
