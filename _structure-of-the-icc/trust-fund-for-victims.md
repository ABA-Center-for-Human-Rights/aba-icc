[The Trust Fund](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/defence/Pages/defence.aspx)'s (TFV) dual mandate serves victims of crimes that fall within the Court's jurisdiction through the provision of 1) general assistance including physical rehabilitation, psychological rehabilitation, and/or material support and 2) implementation of reparations awards ordered by the Court against a convicted person.

#### Composition

The TFV is comprised of a five-member Board of Directors elected by the ASP for three-year terms. The five seats are distributed according to the five major world regions. Each member serves in an individual capacity on a pro bono basis.

TFV projects are funded through fines and forfeitures of convicted persons, voluntary donations by member states and individual donors. To implement services and programs, the TFV collaborates with national and international partners through a grant-making process.

#### Responsibility

The two mandates of the TFV, general assistance and reparations, were established to provide support to victims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed. The key difference between the assistance and reparations mandates is that reparations are linked to accountability, arising from individual criminal responsibility of a convicted person, whereas the assistance mandate is not.

The TFVâ€™s assistance mandate enables victims and their families to receive assistance prior to a conviction by the Court. The assistance mandate is crucial in helping to repair the harm that victims have suffered, by providing assistance: 1) in a timelier manner than the judicial process may allowed, and 2) to a more extensive range of victims who are affected by the broader situations before the Court, regardless of whether the harm they suffered stems from particular crimes charged in a specific case.

The TFV is responsible for implementing reparations as ordered by the Court. The Court determines the most appropriate forms of reparation in light of the context of the case, and in light of the rights and wishes of the victims and their communities. Reparations may be individual or collective, and can take many different forms, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation. However, reparations are not limited to just individual, monetary compensation; they may also be awarded in more collective or symbolic forms, as measures that can help to promote reconciliation within divided communities.

Since 2008, the Trust Fund has implemented projects in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing support to over 110,000 victims of crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court. Over 5,000 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence including girls abducted and/or conscripted and sexually enslaved by armed groups, and children of women victimized by campaigns of mass rape and displacement have been supported by Trust Fund projects.
