The [Registry](http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/registry/Pages/the%20registry.aspx) provides judicial and administrative support to all organs of the Court and carries out its specific responsibilities in the areas of defense, victims and witnesses, outreach and detention.

**Composition**

It is headed by the Registrar who is the principal administrative officer of the Court and oversees various offices and sections that perform specific administrative and supportive tasks.

**Responsibility**

In addition to providing all administrative support for the Court's activities both at the headquarters in The Hague and in the field, the Registry has specific responsibilities in particular areas of the Court's mandate. In the area of defense, the Registry protects the rights of defendants by administering the legal aid program for indigent defendants and providing various forms of assistance to defense counsel. The Registry provides a similar counsel support function to victims as well as ensuring the safety and support of witnesses and victims. The Registry also performs an essential outreach function by ensuring that affected communities in situations subject to investigation or proceedings can understand and follow the work of the Court through the different phases of its activities. The Registry is also responsible for administering and coordinating the detention of all those detained under the ICC's authority.
