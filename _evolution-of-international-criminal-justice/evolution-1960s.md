##### May 11, 1960-May 31, 1962

After Israeli secret police arrested him in Argentina, Adolf Eichmann is prosecuted and convicted in Israeli courts for the ruthless extermination of millions of Jews during World War II. It marked the first conviction for genocide (retroactively) and a seminal moment in the use of universal jurisdiction by a national jurisdiction for international atrocity crimes.
