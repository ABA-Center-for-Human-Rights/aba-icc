The Special Court for Sierra Leone was a hybrid court, having jurisdiction over 'persons who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.' The court was established following a decade long civil war between the government and the United Revolutionary Front (RUF), led by Foday Sankoh and supported by former Liberian President Charles Taylor. Taylor was accused of using profits from illegal diamond mines to finance the RUF, and was [convicted of aiding and abetting war crimes on April 2, 2012](https://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/21/2judgment.pdf)[](http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=t14fjFP4jJ8%253D&tabid=53), affirmed on appeal.[^source2002jan]
