**1919**

Following World War I, the negotiators of the [Treaty of Versailles](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/parti.asp) proposed establishing an international court to try the Kaiser and German war criminals.

Though the Kaiser was never tried, the proposal remained in Article 227 of the Treaty of Versailles[^Source].
