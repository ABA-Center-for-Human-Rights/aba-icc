##### June 6, 2003

The Royal Government of Cambodia and the United Nations signed an agreement establishing the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). The ECCC is a hybrid-internationalized domestic court, having jurisdiction over 'senior leaders of Democratic Kampuchea and those who were most responsible for the crimes and serious violations of Cambodian penal law, international humanitarian law and custom, and international conventions recognized by Cambodia' between April 17, 1975 to January 6, 1979, or the duration of the Khmer Rouge regime. The court was established following a 20 year civil war in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge regime fell in 1979. The Khmer Rouge regime is believed to be responsible for the deaths of at least 1.7 million civilians through starvation, torture, execution and forced labor during its close to four year reign.<sup id="fnref:source2003jun"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:source2003jun">4</a></sup>
