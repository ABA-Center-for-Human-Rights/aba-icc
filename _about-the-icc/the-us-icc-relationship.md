The United States historically has been and continues to be  an an ardent supporter of international criminal justice, having played critical roles in the establishment and operations of the U.N. War Crimes Commission, the World War II tribunals at Nuremberg and  Tokyo, and the modern U.N. *ad hoc* and  hybrid international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Lebanon and others. The International Criminal Court (ICC), the only permanent international criminal tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute the atrocity crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression, is the preeminent historical achievement in international criminal justice.  At present 123 nations have ratified the Rome Statute and are members of the Assembly of States Parties of the Court. But while the U.S. played a central role in the establishment of the Rome Statute that created the ICC, the U.S.  today remains a non-State Party.
Building upon  positive developments at the end of the George W. Bush administration, the US-ICC relationship has significantly progressed during the Barack Obama administration, with the US providing varied and important support to the Court consistent with current US policies. . The following timeline briefly chronicles the US role in international criminal justice, the creation of the ICC, and the evolution of US-ICC relations from World War II to the present.
