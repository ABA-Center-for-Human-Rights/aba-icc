The ICC is the world's only permanent tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute&nbsp;*genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes*, or collectively called "*atrocity crimes*". While these crimes have many overlapping characteristics and a criminal act could be one, two, or all three of them, the three atrocity crimes are distinct.

**War Crimes** are criminal acts committed *within the context of an armed conflict*, whether an international one or a civil war. The criminal act must be related to the armed conflict, so a random theft done during a conflict is not a "war crime". What "criminal acts" are war crimes are many, from illegal seizure of property to murder.

**Crimes Against Humanity** (CAH) are criminal acts committed *within the context of a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population*. What "criminal acts" are CAH are numerous, but most notably include murder, rape, persecution, extermination, and torture. CAH can occur during an armed conflict or peace. Both CAH and War Crimes are certain criminal acts committed within a context (specifically, armed conflict and/or widespread and systematic attack).&nbsp;

**Genocide**&nbsp;is criminal acts committed with the *intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group*, and such acts include killing or imposing measures to prevent births, for instance. Unlike CAH or War Crimes, Genocide does not require a particular context to be happening simultaneously to be a Genocide. However, like CAH, Genocide can happen during war or peace.&nbsp;
