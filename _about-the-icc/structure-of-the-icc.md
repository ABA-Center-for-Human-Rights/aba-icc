The ICC is an international judicial body that was formed by a multilateral treaty called the Rome Statute. The ICC, which is independent of the United Nations, is based in The Hague, the Netherlands, although it may sit elsewhere.

The ICC is composed of four primary organs: The Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry. The Assembly of States Parties serves as The Court's oversight body and not an organ of the Court.
