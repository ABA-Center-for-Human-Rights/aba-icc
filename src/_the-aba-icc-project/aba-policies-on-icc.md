Excerpt: "ABA Policities on the International Criminal Court"

### The elected 560-member ABA House of Delegates has ultimate responsibility for establishing association [policy] (http://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2013/08/aba_house_of_delegat6.html)
on professional and public issues. Twice a year, this body debates and votes on proposed policies. 

###Beginning with a policy in 1978 supporting the idea of a permanent international criminal court, the ABA has passed 
policies supportive of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ABA policy positions have advocated for
the adoption of the Rome Statute (the multilateral treaty that created the ICC) and urged the U.S. to become a State Party. 
Most recently, the ABA urged the U.S. government to forge greater support for, and engagement with, the ICC.

###Please find below summaries and links to all of the ABA policies related to the ICC.
