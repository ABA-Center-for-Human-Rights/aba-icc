This is the news. yo.

#### NEED
- Put title up in the splash area, if not it goes in the normal space.  
- add metadata to posts  
- style post page
- come up with default image if there is no featured image.
- come up with a good image to dress up the aggregate page
- how to handle events? they should link to news post about the event (or the event post becomes the news post) - but need a way to single them out.
