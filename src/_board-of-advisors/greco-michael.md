Michael S. Greco is a trial lawyer, arbitrator and mediator with forty years of experience in resolving disputes throughout the US and internationally. He is former president of the American Bar Association (2005-2006) and currently chairs the *ABA Center for Human Rights Advisory Council*, the *ABA-ICC Project* and the Project's Board of Advisors, and the *ABA Working Group on a Right to Counsel in Civil Matters*. He is a Visiting Professor of the Practice of Law at Peking University School of Transnational Law, Shenzhen, China, and teaches the course *International Criminal Justice*.

As President of the ABA in 2005, among another priorities, he appointed the *ABA Task Force on Access to Civil Justice* to consider the idea of providing desperately needed legal services to millions of poor Americans, eighty percent of whose legal needs annually go unmet, through recognition and implementation of a right to counsel in civil matters, for violations of human rights and civil rights that threaten one's basic needsâ€”shelter, health, sustenance, safety and child custody. The 560-member ABA House of Delegates by unanimous vote endorsed a right to counsel in civil matters in the US. The *ABA Working Group* in August 2014 will release the *ABA Judges' Manual for Appointment of Counsel in Civil Matters*, to aid judges throughout the US in determining applicable laws, rules and judicial discretion bearing on appointment of counsel in civil matters that threaten human rights.

He has received awards and honorary degrees for his work protecting legal aid to indigents in the US and protecting human rights and the rule of law domestically and internationally. At the invitation of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights he has served as an expert on human rights and legal aid, working with human rights experts in Latin America to improve the delivery of civil and criminal legal aid in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

He is a graduate of Princeton University and Boston College Law School where he served as editor in chief of the *Law Review*. Prior to law school he taught English for two years at Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire.  After law school he served as Law Clerk to the Hon. Leonard P. Moore of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, and as a Fellow at the Institute of Comparative Law, University of Florence, Italy.
