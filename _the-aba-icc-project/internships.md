The American Bar Association's (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project offers internships throughout the year to qualified individuals from anywhere in the world who have demonstrated an interest in the promotion of international criminal justice. Interns with the ABA's ICC Project undertake a wide variety of different work assignments, such as helping organizing advocacy events in Washington, D.C. and around the world, conducting research for material to be published on our websites, drafting memoranda on interesting issues in international criminal justice, and helping maintain work relationships with outside organizations and entities. In addition to working on the ABA's ICC Project, interns are offered the opportunity to assist other programs within the [ABA Criminal Justice Section](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/).

Interns generally work from the ABA office in central Washington, D.C., but remote internships may be considered. Internships are unpaid, and can be completed for credit in accordance with relevant academic programs. There is a strong preference for applicants currently in law school with an understanding of international law; however, undergraduate applicants with background in international law and demonstrated capacity to work on typical ABA's ICC Project activities may be considered.&nbsp;*The ABA commits itself to building a multifaceted and diverse workforce, and thus strongly encourages applicants of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnic, religious, or other self-identified background.*
